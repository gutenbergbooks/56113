<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="noindent">When <i>River and Canal Engineering</i> was written it was
decided to omit Irrigation works and to deal with them
separately because the subject interests chiefly specialists.</p>

<p>The present book deals with the principles which govern
the design and management of Irrigation works, and it
discusses the Canals of Northern India&mdash;the largest and
best in the world&mdash;in detail.</p>

<p>Some years ago a number of rules for designing distributaries
were framed, at the request of the Punjab
Government, by the late Colonel S. L. Jacob, C.I.E., R.E.,
and comments on these rules were obtained from many
experienced engineers and recorded. The author has had
the advantage of reading all these opinions. Generally
the weight of opinion on any point agrees with what most
experienced engineers would suggest, and direct conflicts
of opinion scarcely occur. Important papers have been
printed by the Punjab Irrigation Branch on Losses of
Water and the Design of Distributaries, on the great
Triple Canal Project, on Gibb&#8217;s Module, on Kennedy&#8217;s
Gauge Outlet, and on the Lining of Watercourses.
These papers are not always accessible to engineers, and
the chief points of interest in them are not, in most cases,
discernible at a glance. Such points have been extracted
and are given in this book.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="chapname">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>

<h3 class="inline">1. <b>Preliminary Remarks.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&mdash;The largest irrigation
canals are fed from perennial rivers. When the canal
flows throughout the year it is called a &#8220;Perennial
Canal.&#8221; Chief among these are the canals of India
and particularly those of Northern India, some of which
have bed widths ranging up to 300 feet, depths of water
up to 11 feet and discharges up to 10,000 c. ft. per
second. Other large canals as for instance many of
those in Scinde, Egypt and the Punjab, though fed
from perennial rivers, flow only when the rivers are
high. These are called &#8220;Inundation Canals.&#8221; Many
canals, generally of moderate or small size, in other
countries and notably in the Western States of America,
in Italy, Spain, France and South Africa, are fed from
rivers and great numbers of small canals from reservoirs
in which streams or rain-water have been impounded.
Sometimes water for irrigation is pumped from wells
and conveyed in small canals. In Australia a good deal
of irrigation is effected from artesian wells. Irrigation
works on a considerable scale are being undertaken in
Mexico and the Argentine. In this book, irrigation
works of various countries are referred to and to some
extent described, but the perennial canal of Northern
India, with its distributaries, is the type taken as a
basis for the description of the principles and methods
which should be adopted in the design, working and
improvement of irrigation channels and it is to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page2">[2]</span>
understood that such a canal is being referred to where
the context does not indicate the contrary. Any reader
who is concerned with irrigation in some other part of
the world will be able to judge for himself how far these
principles and methods require modification. The
branches and distributaries&mdash;all of which are dealt with&mdash;of
a large perennial canal cover all possible sizes.</p>

<p><a href="#Page30"><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> II.</a> of this book deals with the design of
canals and <a href="#Page96"><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> III.</a> with the working of canals but
as the two subjects are to some extent interdependent,
they will both be dealt with in a preliminary manner
in the remaining articles of the present Chapter.
<a href="#Page144"><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> IV.</a> describes the Punjab Triple Canal
<span class="nowrap">Project.<a id="FNanchor1" href="#Footnote1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span>
<a href="#Page158"><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> V.</a> deals with certain proposed improvements
in the working of canals.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote1"><a href="#FNanchor1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The latest example of canal design.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref6">2. <b>General Principles of Canal Design.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&mdash;The head
of a canal has to be so high up the river that, when the
canal is suitably graded, the water level will come out
high enough to irrigate the tract of land concerned. If
a river has a general slope of a foot per mile and if the
adjoining country has the same slope and is a foot
higher than the water level of the river, and if a canal
is made at a very acute angle with the river, with a
slope of half a foot per mile, the water level about two
miles from the canal head will be level with the ground.</p>

<p>The headworks of the canal consist of a weir&mdash;which
may be provided with sluices&mdash;across the river, and a
head &#8220;regulator,&#8221; provided with gates, for the canal.
There are however many canals, those for instance of
the inundation canal class, which have no works in the
river and these may go dry when the river is low.<span class="pagenum" id="Page3">[3]</span>
They usually have a regulator to prevent too much
water from going down the canal during floods. If a
canal is fed from a reservoir the headworks consist simply
of a sluice or sluices.</p>

<p>A canal must be so designed as to bring the water to
within reasonable distance of every part of the area to
be irrigated. Unless the area is small or narrow the
canal must have &#8220;branches&#8221; and &#8220;distributaries.&#8221; A
general sketch of a large canal is given in <a href="#Fig1">Fig. 1</a>. On a
large canal, irrigation is not usually done directly from
the canal and branches. It is all done from the
distributaries.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig1">
<img src="images/illo013.png" alt="Map" width="350" height="582" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page4">[4]</span></p>

<p>From each distributary &#8220;watercourses&#8221; take off at
intervals and convey the water to the fields. A small
canal, say one whose length is not more than 15 miles
or whose discharge is not more than 100 c. feet per
second, may be regarded as a distributary and the word
distributary will be used with this extended meaning.</p>

<p>It is not always the case that the whole tract covered
by a system of canal channels is irrigated. In the case
of a canal fed from a river, the land near the river is
often high or broken and the main canal runs for some
distance before it reaches the tract to be irrigated.
Again, within this tract there are usually portions of
land too high to be irrigated. Those portions of the
tract which can be irrigated are called the &#8220;commanded
area.&#8221;</p>

<p>The channels of a large irrigation system should run
on high ground. In the case of a distributary, this is
necessary in order that the water-courses may run
downhill, and since the water in the canal and branches
has to flow into the distributaries, the canal and
branches must also be in high ground. Another reason
for adopting high ground is that all the channels should,
as far as possible, keep away from the natural drainage
lines of the country and not obstruct them. Also a
channel in high ground is cheapest and safest. When a
channel is in low ground it must have high banks which
are expensive to make and liable to breach. Every tract
of country possesses more or less defined ridges and
valleys. When the ridges are well defined, the irrigation
channels, especially the distributaries, follow them approximately,
deviating slightly on one side or the other
from the very top of the ridge in order to secure a more<span class="pagenum" id="Page5">[5]</span>
direct course. If any part of a ridge is so high as to
necessitate deep digging the channel does not necessarily
go through it. It may skirt it and return to the crest of
the ridge further on, especially if this arrangement
shortens the channel or at least does not lengthen it
much. A channel also goes off the ridge sometimes
when adherence to it would give a crooked line. Of
course all the channels&mdash;canals, branches and distributaries&mdash;have
to flow more or less in the direction of
the general slope of the tract being dealt with.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig2">
<img src="images/illo015.png" alt="Example" width="250" height="316" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.</p>
</div>

<p>The alignments of the channels do not, however,
depend exclusively on the physical features of the
country. Centrality in the alignment is desirable. It
will be shown (<a href="#Ref1"><span class="smcap">Chap.</span> II. Art. 10</a>) that a distributary
works most economically when it runs down the centre
of the tract which it has to irrigate. It is better to have
short watercourses running off from both sides of a
distributary than long watercourses from only one side.
The same is true of a branch; it should run down the
centre of its tract of country. Again the angles at which
the channels branch off have to be considered. If
branches were taken off very high up the canal and ran
parallel to and not far from it, there would be an
excessive length of channel. But neither should the
branches be so arranged as to form a series of right
angles. In the case shown in <a href="#Fig2">Fig. 2</a> the size of the main<span class="pagenum" id="Page6">[6]</span>
or central canal would of course be reduced at the point
A. By altering the branches to the positions shown in
dotted lines their length is not appreciably increased
while the length A B is made of the reduced instead of
the full size. Moreover the course B C is more direct
than BAC and this may be of the greatest importance
as regards gaining the necessary command. When a
channel bifurcates, the total wet border always increases
and there is then a greater loss from absorption. The
water is always kept in bulk as long as possible. If the
alignment of a branch is somewhat crooked it does not
follow that straightening it&mdash;supposing the features of
the country admit of this&mdash;will be desirable. It may
increase the length of distributaries taken off near the
bends. It will be shown (<a href="#Ref1"><span class="smcap">Chap.</span> II. Art. 10</a>) that a
distributary ought, when matters can be so arranged, to
irrigate the country for two miles on either side of it,
and watercourses should be two or three miles long.
A distributary need not therefore extend right up to the
boundary of the commanded area but stop two or three
miles from it. Generally it is not desirable to prolong
a distributary and make it &#8220;tail&#8221; into another channel
(<a href="#Ref2"><span class="smcap">Chap.</span> II. Art. 3</a>). A distributary, like a canal, may
give off branches.</p>

<p>None of the rules mentioned in the preceding paragraph
are intended to be other than general guides, to be
followed as far as the physical features of the country
permit, or to assist in deciding between alternative
schemes. It may for instance be a question whether to
construct one distributary or two, between two nearly
parallel branches. The two-mile rule may enable the
matter to be decided or it may influence the decision
arrived at as to the exact alignments of the branches.<span class="pagenum" id="Page7">[7]</span>
The flatter the country and the less marked the ridges
the more the alignment can be based on the above rules.
Sometimes, as in the low land adjoining a river, the
ridges are ill defined or non-existent and the alignment
is based entirely on the above rules. The rule as to
following high ground need not be adhered to at the
tail of any distributary if all the land to be irrigated at
the tail is low and if there is a deep drainage line or
other feature of the country such as to preclude the
possibility of an extension of the distributary. Possible
extensions should always be considered. In hilly districts
an irrigation canal may have to run in sidelong
ground along the side of a valley.</p>

<p>In flat valleys, owing to the land nearest the river
having received successive deposits of silt in floods, the
ground generally slopes away from the river and a canal
can irrigate the low land even if taken off at right
angles to the river. But to irrigate the high land near
the river and the land where it rises again towards the
hills or watershed, a canal taking off higher up the river
is necessary. Of course much depends on whether the
canal is to irrigate when the river is low or only when
it is high, and whether or not there is to be a weir in the
river. In Upper Egypt, it is common for a high level
canal taking off far upstream, to divide into two
branches, one for the land near the river and one for the
land towards the watershed, and for both branches to be
crossed&mdash;by means of syphons&mdash;by a low-level canal
which irrigates the low ground. Similar arrangements
sometimes occur on Indian inundation canals.</p>

<p>Regulators are usually provided at all off-takes of
branches. In the case of a channel taking off from<span class="pagenum" id="Page8">[8]</span>
another channel many times its own size there is
generally only the head regulator of the smaller channel
but in other cases there is a regulator in each channel
below the bifurcation. Thus, when the number of
bifurcating channels is two it is called a double regulator.
Regulators, with the &#8220;falls&#8221;&mdash;introduced to flatten
the gradients when the slope of the country is
too steep&mdash;and drainage crossings and the bridges,
provided at the principal roads, constitute the chief
masonry works on a canal. At a fall, mills are
often constructed or the fall may be used for electric
power.</p>

<p>Regarding curves and bends in channels, it is explained
in <i>River and Canal Engineering</i> that, as regards increased
resistance to flow and consequent tendency to
silt deposit, curves of fair radius have very little effect,
that a curve of a given angle may perhaps have the
same effect whether the radius is great or small but that
if the radius is large a succession of curves cannot be
got into a short length, that a succession of sharp curves
in a short length may have great effect, amounting to
an increase of N in Kutter&#8217;s co-efficient, that a single
sharp curve has not much effect, that the chief objection
to such a curve is the tendency to erosion of the bank,
that at a place where the channel has, in any case, to
be protected, as for instance just below a weir or fall,
there is no objection to the introduction of a sharp bend
and that such bends, in fact right-angled elbows, exist
without any evil effects at many regulators when the
whole supply is being turned into a branch. It is
remarkable that on perennial canals no advantage is
ever taken of the last mentioned fact. Cases undoubtedly
occur, though somewhat infrequently, in which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page9">[9]</span>
most suitable and cheapest arrangement would be to
give a canal an abrupt bend at a fall. In order to reduce
eddying, the bend need not be an absolute elbow but
can be made within the length of the pitching which
would be curved instead of straight. This is frequently
done on inundation canals, without the slightest drawback,
even when there is no fall, the pitching at bridges
being utilised. A pitched bend can be made anywhere.</p>

<p>When a river floods the country along its banks as in
parts of Egypt and of the Punjab, it is generally
necessary to construct marginal embankments before
irrigation can be introduced. The canal may take off
at a point where flooding does not occur or it may pass
through the <span class="nowrap">embankment.<a id="FNanchor2" href="#Footnote2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span> If it passes through at a
point where flooding occurs, a masonry regulator is constructed
to prevent the floods from enlarging the gap
and breaking into the country.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote2"><a href="#FNanchor2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
For detailed accounts of such embankments and canals see <i>Punjab
Rivers and Works</i> (Spon) 1912.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>A large canal is provided, so far as is practicable, with
&#8220;escapes&#8221; by means of which surplus water may be let
out. Surplus water occurs chiefly after rain. At such
times the demand for water may suddenly be reduced
and if there were no escapes there would probably be
serious breaches of the banks before there was time for
the reduction of water, effected at the head of the
canal, to take effect lower down. There is usually an
escape at some point in the main line, preferably at a
point where it divides into branches, and this escape
runs back to the river. There may also be escapes near
the tails of the longest branches. These escapes may
discharge into drainages or into reservoirs formed by
running a low embankment round a large area of waste
land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page10">[10]</span></p>

<p>The drainage of the whole tract irrigated by a canal
must be carefully seen to. The subsoil water level of a
tract of country is nearly always raised by an irrigation
canal. The rise near to a canal or distributary is due
to percolation from the channel and is <span class="nowrap">inevitable.<a id="FNanchor3"
href="#Footnote3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span> The
rise at places further away, if it occurs, is due to over-watering
or to neglect of drainage. Immense damage
has been done by &#8220;water-logging&#8221; of the soil when
irrigation water has been supplied to a tract of flat
country and the clearance and improvement of the
natural drainages has not been attended to. Any
drainages crossed by the banks of the irrigation channels
should be provided with syphons or aqueducts or else
the drainage diverted into another channel. Very frequently
the main line of a canal&mdash;whether great or
small&mdash;in the upper reaches near the hills, has to cross
heavy drainage channels or torrents and large and
expensive works are required for this.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote3"><a href="#FNanchor3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
But see <a href="#Page158">Chap. V.</a> as to reduction of percolation.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Near the head of a canal and of every branch and
distributary, there is an ordinary gauge which shows the
depth of water and is read daily. The gauge near the
head of a main canal is generally self-registering.</p>

<p>The principles sketched out in this article are those
generally followed in the designs of modern canals.
They have by no means been followed in all cases. In
some of the older Indian canals both the canal and
the distributaries ran in low ground. Water-courses
took off direct from the canals, and the irrigation did
not generally extend far from the canal. In fact long
distributaries were impracticable because they would
have run into high ground. The banks of the channels
obstructed drainages and caused pestilential swamps.<span class="pagenum" id="Page11">[11]</span>
Most canals of this type have been abolished since the
advent of British rule and replaced by others properly
designed. Some badly designed canals however, mostly
of the inundation class, still exist but in very dry tracts
where drainages are of little consequence.</p>

<h3 class="inline">3. <b>Information Concerning Canals.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&mdash;Nearly all canal
irrigation is done by &#8220;flow,&#8221; the water running from the
water-courses onto the fields, but a small proportion is
done by &#8220;lift.&#8221; This is done in the case of high pieces
of land, the lifting being usually done by pumps or, in
the east, by bullocks or by manual labour.</p>

<p>Irrigation generally consists in giving the land a succession
of waterings, one previous to ploughing and
others after the crop is sown, each watering being of
quite moderate depth. On inundation canals in India
the waterings for the summer crop are thus effected but
for the winter crop the land is deeply soaked during the
flood season and is afterwards ploughed and sown. In
Upper Egypt this system is emphasised, the water
flowing into vast basins, formed by dykes, where it
stands for some time and, after depositing its silt, is
drained off.</p>

<p>Until recent times the whole of the irrigation of
Egypt was basin irrigation. In Lower Egypt the construction
of the Nile barrage led to the introduction of
canals which take off at a proper level and their working
is not restricted to the period when the river is in flood.
In Upper Egypt most of the irrigation is still basin
irrigation but the canals taking off above the Assiut
barrage form a notable exception. By means of the
Assouan dam which crosses the Nile, the water during<span class="pagenum" id="Page12">[12]</span>
the latter part of the flood season and after the floods
are over, i.e. from November to March, is ponded up
and a vast reservoir formed and the impounded water is
let down the river in May and June.</p>

<p>In some of the older irrigation canals of India the
velocity was too high and the channels have since had
to be remodelled and the crests of weirs raised or new
weirs built. The more recent canals are free from grave
defects of this kind but every canal undergoes changes
of some kind and finality has never yet been quite
attained.</p>

<p>On some Indian irrigation canals made about 30
years ago, great sums of money were wasted in making
the canals navigable. There is nothing like enough
navigation to pay for the extra cost. The idea has now
been quite given up except as regards timber rafting
from upstream. This requires no curtailment of
the velocity in the channels. The requirements
of the irrigation and navigation were always in conflict.
The mere fact that branches have to be worked in turns
is enough to prevent navigation succeeding.</p>

<p>In India the water used for irrigation is paid for, not
according to the volume used but according to the area
irrigated. The volume used in any particular watercourse
is not known. The areas sown are measured.
Certain kinds of crops use up more water than others and
the charges are fixed accordingly.</p>

<p>In the canals which have their headworks among the
mountains of Western America there are frequent tunnels
and syphons and the canals often run in steep
sidelong ground. There are great lengths of tunnel and<span class="pagenum" id="Page13">[13]</span>
syphon in the Marseilles and Verdun Canals and there
are long tunnels in the Periyar Canal in Madras and in
the Upper Swat Canal in the North West Frontier
Province of India.</p>

<p>The Tieton Canal, Washington, U.S.A., traverses
steep sidelong ground which would be liable to slip if
a large cutting were made. The cross-section of the
channel is a circle, 8-ft. 3&sup1;&#8260;&#8322;-ins. in diameter, with the
upper part removed, so that the depth is 6 feet. It is
made of reinforced concrete 4 inches thick and the sides
are tied together by iron bars which run across the
channel above the water. In the Santa Ana Canal the
channel consists for 2&sup1;&#8260;&#8322; miles of a flume made of wooden
&#8220;staves.&#8221;</p>

<p>A canal constructed in Wyoming, U.S.A., after taking
off from a river, passes through a tunnel into another
valley and is turned into another stream which thus
becomes the canal. This is said to save loss of water
by percolation. The stream is winding while a canal
could have been made straighter. There may, owing to
the ground near the stream being saturated, have been
less loss of water at first than there would have been in
the artificial channel but, owing to the smaller wetted
area, there would probably have been an eventual saving
in adopting the latter. The real advantage of adopting
the natural stream was probably a saving in the cost of
construction. (<i>Min. Proc. Inst. C.E.</i> Vol. CLXII.)</p>

<p>Irrigation from canals which are supplied from reservoirs
differs in no respect from that from other canals.
The principles on which reservoir capacities should be
calculated and earthen and masonry dams constructed
are given in <i>River and Canal Engineering</i>. Sometimes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page14">[14]</span>
as for instance when a reservoir becomes seriously
reduced in size owing to silt deposit, the water is run
off after the bed of the reservoir has been soaked, and
crops are grown on the soaked soil.</p>

<p>The distribution of the water of a canal as between
the main channel and the branches, is effected by means
of the regulators at the bifurcations. When the supply
is ample and the demand great, the channels may all
be running nearly full. When the demand exceeds the
supply, the water may be reduced proportionately in each
branch but this may result in the water of a branch
being too low to give proper supplies to the distributaries
or some of them, and in the water of a distributary not
commanding the higher ground. Moreover it violates
the principle of keeping the water in bulk as far as
possible. It is more usual to give each branch full
supply, or a certain large fraction of the full supply, in
turn, and similarly with the distributaries.</p>

<p>The method of distribution from a distributary to the
watercourses varies. In many modern canals there is,
at each watercourse head, a sluice which is adjusted at
frequent intervals according to the supply and the
demand. One method, which is excellent because it
fulfils in the highest degree the principle of keeping the
water in bulk, is to have very large watercourses and,
by means of regulators which are built at frequent
intervals, to turn the whole of the water of the distributary
into a few watercourses at a time, beginning with
those nearest the head of the distributary and working
downstream. But a system which seems eminently
suitable may be impracticable because of local circumstances.
In India, any such arrangement would need an
army of officials and would lead to unbounded corruption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page15">[15]</span></p>

<p>In India the water from a distributary enters the
watercourses through &#8220;outlets&#8221; which are small masonry
tubes passing through the banks of the distributary.
There is no easy way of closing these outlets or at least
of keeping them closed if the cultivators choose to open
them, but it is easy to close a whole distributary and so
regulate the supply. This is the chief reason why watercourses
in India do not usually take off direct from the
canals.</p>

<p>The presence of silt in the water of a river from
which a canal is drawn is often spoken of as being a
great evil. If it is an evil at all it is a very mixed evil.
The deposits of silt in the channels have been enormously
reduced by the application of scientific principles of
design. The clayey silt which remains in the water and
reaches the fields, brings to them greatly increased
fertility.</p>

<p>In India the fertility of the soil is often reduced or
destroyed by the formation on the surface of the ground
of an efflorescence called &#8220;reh.&#8221; It consists of various
salts or compounds of sodium and occurs chiefly where
there is an impervious layer of subsoil. The salts exist
as an ingredient of the upper soil. This becomes saturated
with rain or canal water and as the water
evaporates the salts are left on the surface. Remedies
are drainage, or flooding the soil and running the water
off, or deep tilling, or chemical treatment with lime or
gypsum. (<i>Indian Engineering, 8th Jan., 1910</i>).</p>

<p>The inundation canals of the Punjab have been
described in <i>Punjab Rivers and Works</i>. All descriptions
and remarks in the present book regarding Indian canals
must be assumed to refer to perennial canals unless the
contrary is stated or implied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page16">[16]</span></p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref18">4. <b>Losses of Water.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&mdash;When water flows or stands
in an earthen channel or tank, or is spread over a field,
losses occur from evaporation, percolation and absorption.
Of these, absorption is by far the most
important and, unless the contrary is stated or implied,
it will be taken to include the others. The losses by
evaporation are very small. The loss by evaporation
from the surface of the water, even in the hot season
in India when a hot wind often blows, does not exceed
half an inch in 24 hours and on the average in India is
only about a tenth of an inch in 24 hours.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig3">
<img src="images/illo026.png" alt="Percolation" width="300" height="262" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3.</p>
</div>

<p>Percolation and absorption are described as follows
by Beresford in <i>Punjab Irrigation Paper</i>, No. 10,
&#8220;The Irrigation Duty of Water.&#8221; Percolation consists
in flow through the interstices of boulders, shingle,
gravel or coarse sand. The flow is similar to that in
pipes. The water percolating into the soil from a
channel, extends downwards and spreads outwards as it
descends. None of it goes upwards. In fine sand and
ordinary soil the interstices act like capillary tubes.
The water is absorbed as by a sponge and it remains in
the soil by virtue of capillarity. Owing to the combined
action of capillarity and gravity the water spreads in the
manner shown by the dotted lines in <a href="#Fig3">Fig. 3</a>. The
amount of absorption from a channel will be greater
the greater the area of the wetted surface. In a high<span class="pagenum" id="Page17">[17]</span>
embankment with narrow banks, the absorption ceases
when the water reaches the outer slopes, except in so
far as it is evaporated from the slopes. Moreover high
embankments are generally in clayey soil. If banks of
sand are constructed on a layer of clay (<a href="#Fig4">Fig. 4.</a>) and
well rammed, the absorption ceases as soon as the banks
are saturated and the channel then holds water as well
as any other except for evaporation from the outer
slopes, but if the bed and subsoil are also of sand the
absorption of the water will be far greater. Absorption
ceases when the water extends nearly down to the level
of the subsoil water, i.e., to a point where the effect of
absorption from above plus gravitation is equal to the
effect of absorption from below minus gravitation. If
a bottle is filled with water and a small sponge jammed
into the neck and the bottle turned upside down, the
sponge becomes saturated but no water will be given
out. But if a dry sponge is placed in contact with the
wet one it will absorb moisture until saturated.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig4">
<img src="images/illo027.png" alt="Banks" width="300" height="75" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 4.</p>
</div>

<p>It is known that the loss of water is greatly influenced
by the nature of the soil. When water is turned into a
dry channel or onto a field, the loss is at first great. It
decreases hourly and daily and eventually becomes
nearly constant, tending to reach a fixed amount when
the water extends down to nearly the level of the subsoil
water. Observations made by Kennedy on loamy
fields near the Bari Doab Canal in India showed that on
a field previously dry the rate of absorption is given by
the equation</p>

<p class="formula"><i>y</i> = &middot;0891 <i>x</i> <sup>&middot;86.</sup></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page18">[18]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Where <i>y</i> is the depth of water absorbed in feet and <i>x</i>
is the time in hours. The observations extended over
eight days. Denoting by <i>c</i> the depth of water in feet
absorbed in one hour, it was found that on a field on
which no rain had fallen for two months, <i>c</i> was &middot;04
to &middot;05 but on the second watering of the crop about a
month later <i>c</i> was &middot;02 to &middot;03 and about the same on a
third watering. It was found that at the first commencement
the rate of absorption was much affected by
the state of the surface of the ground but that the
effect was only temporary. The losses were found to
be as follows:</p>

<p class="noindent">The reasons for the great variation in the value of <i>c</i> are
not properly known. The depth of water is not
likely to have much influence on it. It is well known
that the fine silt carried by the water tends to render
the channels watertight when it deposits. The canals
and branches receive either no deposits or deposits consisting
chiefly of sand. The distributaries, especially in
their lower reaches, receive deposits of fine silt which
is only occasionally cleared away. The watercourses
receive similar deposits but they are very frequently
cleared out by the cultivators. This is perhaps the
reason why the rate of loss of water in the watercourses
is nearly three times as great as the rate of loss in the
distributaries of the same canal. On the Sirhind canal
the distributaries have more branches than on the Bari
Doab canal and the watercourses are smaller. This
accounts for the different relative losses in the two
cases. The sandy nature of the soil on the Sirhind
canal accounts for the general higher value of <i>c</i> on that
canal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page21">[21]</span></p>

<p>The following formula has been deduced as giving
the loss by absorption on a Punjab Canal.</p>

<p class="formula">P = 3&middot;5 &#8730;<span class="bt">d</span> <span class="horsplit"><span class="top">WL</span>
<span class="bot">1,000,000</span></span></p>

<p class="noindent">Where P is the loss by absorption in c. ft. per second
in a reach whose length is L, width (at water level) W
and depth d. According to the formula the loss per
million square feet is 10&middot;5 c. ft. per second when d is 4
ft. and 7 c. ft. per second when d is 2 feet, These
figures do not agree with those in the preceding table
and it is clear that there are not yet sufficient data from
which to construct a formula.</p>

<p>The first steps taken on the Bari Doab Canal, and
subsequently on other canals, to reduce the losses of
water, consisted in the reduction in the number of watercourses.
This will be referred to again (<a href="#Ref4"><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> II.
Art. 9</a>). Further steps will be considered in <a href="#Page158"><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> V.</a></p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref15">5. <b>Duty of Water.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&mdash;The number of acres irrigated
annually by a constant discharge of 1 c. ft. of water per
second is called the &#8220;duty&#8221; of water. In India on
perennial canals the duty may be as much as 250 or
even 300 acres. On inundation canals which flow for
only five months in the year and are situated in tracts
of scanty rainfall and light or sandy soil, the duty may
be only 70 acres. The duties of most existing canals
whether in India or elsewhere, are known only approximately.
The duty is calculated on the average discharge
entering the canal at its head less the water which is
passed out at escapes. It thus includes all losses of water.
The duty varies not only as between one canal and
another but on the same canal from year to year. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page22">[22]</span>
depends on the character of the soil, a sandy soil requiring
more water than a clayey soil. It also depends
on the rainfall. A moderate amount of rain causes the
canal water to go further, but heavy rain may enable
some crops to do without canal water or may permit of
the concealment of canal irrigation. The duty also
depends on the kind of crops grown, on the losses in the
channels by absorption and on the quantity of water
available. A liberal supply of water leads to carelessness
in the use, but a very restricted supply is largely wasted
owing to the shortness of the &#8220;turns&#8221; or rotational
periods of flow in the different channels.</p>

<p>There is an obvious connection between the duty of
water and the total depth of the water, known in India
as &#8220;delta,&#8221; given to the fields. Calculations are much
simplified, while still being accurate enough for all practical
purposes, by assuming that the number of seconds,
(86,400) in a day is twice the number of square feet,
(43,560) in an acre. Assuming this to be the case a
discharge of 1 c. ft. per second for a day gives 2 acre-feet,
i.e., it will cover an acre of ground to a depth of 2
feet in a day; and in six months it will cover 100 acres
to depth of 3&middot;65 feet. In Northern India the year is
divided into two halves in each of which a crop is grown
and the duty is calculated for each crop. In this case,
if the flow of a canal has been continuous, a duty of 100
acres per cubic foot of its mean discharge per second,
corresponds to a total depth of 3&middot;65 feet over the area
irrigated. Generally the flow in the half-year has not
been continuous. In other countries, and in India on
canals other than the perennial canals, the periods of
flow vary a great deal. The duty cannot be calculated
from delta or <i>vice versa</i> until the period of flow is stated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page23">[23]</span></p>

<p>The daily gauge-readings and daily discharges corresponding
to them, having been booked, the discharges
are added up. The total, divided by the number of
days on which the canal has been running, gives the
average daily discharge. Suppose that during the
&#8220;kharif&#8221; or summer crop which is considered to last from
1st April to 30th September or 183 days, the canal was
closed for 13 days and that the total of the daily discharges
on the remaining 170 days comes to 850,000 c.
ft. per second. The average daily discharge is 5,000 c. ft.
per second. Suppose the kharif area irrigated to be
500,000 acres, the kharif duty is 100 acres. To find
delta the total of the daily discharges has to be multiplied
by the number of seconds in a day and divided by
the number of square feet in an acre (these figures are,
as already stated, very nearly in the ratio of two to one)
and divided again by the number of acres irrigated.
Thus, in the above case, delta is very nearly
<span class="horsplit fsize80"><span class="top">850,000 &times; 2</span><span class="bot">500,000</span></span>
or 3&middot;4 feet. For comparing the results of one canal or
one year with another, delta is the more convenient
figure to take. As soon as the areas irrigated by the
canals are known for any crop, the Chief Engineer of
the province issues a statement of the value of delta
for each perennial canal and compares them with those
for previous years. The value of delta for the Punjab
canals ranges from 3 to 4 feet for the kharif and from
1&middot;8 to 2&middot;1 feet for the &#8220;rabi&#8221; or winter crop. Individual
canals vary greatly, the worst having nearly twice as
high a figure as the best. The differences are due to the
causes already mentioned.</p>

<p>Although the figures of duty take no account of the
number of days a canal was closed, they are the most
convenient standard for judging generally of the work<span class="pagenum" id="Page24">[24]</span>
likely to be done by a projected canal. It will readily
be seen that figures of duty are not exact and are only
an approximate guide. The delta figures are, on the
perennial canals of the Punjab, also worked out for each
month of the crop, the volume of water used from the
beginning of the crop up to the end of the month being
divided by the area irrigated up to the end of the month.
But when irrigation is in full swing, some little delay
occurs in booking the fields. Moreover the same field is
watered a number of times during the crop and much
depends on whether waterings have just been given or
are just about to be given. The figures are useful to
some extent for comparison. The figures for the rabi
crop of 1908-09 were as follows, the figure for March
being the final figure for the crop.</p>

<p>One great principle to be followed in order to obtain
a high duty is to restrict the supply of water. A cultivator
whose watercourse is always running full may
waste great quantities of water, but if he knows that it
is only to run for a few days out of a fortnight he will
use the water carefully. It is not, of course, meant that
the water kept back is run into escapes and wasted. It
goes to irrigate other lands. The available supply
of water should be spread over as large an area
of land as just, and only just, to <span class="nowrap">suffice.<a id="FNanchor6" href="#Footnote6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span> Other
methods of improving the duty are the reduction in the
number of watercourses, the apportionment of the sizes<span class="pagenum" id="Page25">[25]</span>
of outlets, watercourses and distributaries to the work
that they have to do, careful attention to the distribution
of the water and the prevention of wastage due to
carelessness.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote6"><a href="#FNanchor6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a>
A system of lavish supply is in most cases likely to lead to harm by
water-logging of the soil or its exhaustion by over-cropping or to raising of
the spring level and injury to the public health.</p>

<p>The average rabi duties on the Lower Chenab and
Upper Bari Doab Canals, in the Punjab, calculated on
the discharges at the distributary heads, for periods of 3
and 5 years respectively, ending March, 1904, were 208
and 263 acres respectively, but in the latter case 11 per
cent. of the area received only &#8220;first waterings.&#8221; For
the kharif the figures are 100 and 98 respectively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page26">[26]</span></p>

60 to 150 acres. In South California the duty is 150
to 300 acres, when, as is usual, surface irrigation is
employed, but 300 to 500 acres with subsoil irrigation,
the water being delivered in a pipe below ground level
(<a href="#Page158"><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> V.</a>)</p>

<p>In basin irrigation in Egypt the duty is 20 to 25
acres, but the period of flow is only 40 days. The basins
are flooded to about 3 feet in depth.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref7">6. <b>Sketch of a Project.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&mdash;The tract of country to be
dealt with in an irrigation project may be limited either
by the natural features of the country, by its levels, by
the quantity of water available or by financial considerations.
If the tract is small or narrow, and
particularly if it is not very flat, it may be obvious that
there is only one line on which the irrigation channel
can conveniently be constructed but in any considerable
scheme a contour plan of the whole tract is absolutely
necessary. The surveys for such a plan are expensive
and take time and it is desirable, as far as possible, to
settle beforehand the area over which they are to extend.
This may be done to some extent by the examination
of any existing levels and of the tract itself. Very high,
sandy or swampy ground, whether occurring at the edge
of the tract or in the middle of it, may have to be left
out. The remainder, as already mentioned, is called
the commanded area. When land occupied by houses
or roads or which is very much broken, or which for
any reason cannot be irrigated, has also been deducted,
the balance is the &#8220;culturable commanded area.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page27">[27]</span></p>

<p>Either before or after the culturable commanded area
has been approximately ascertained, the proportion of
it which is to be irrigated must be settled. This depends
on local circumstances. In India the supply of water
is calculated on the supposition that a fraction, generally
from &sup1;&#8260;&#8323; to &sup3;&#8260;&#8324;, of the culturable commanded area will be
irrigated each year. The rest will be lying fallow or
be temporarily out of use or be used for crops which do
not require canal irrigation. The restriction of the area
is necessary either because the supply of water is
limited or in the interests of the people. Too liberal a
supply of water tends, as already stated, to over cultivation,
and exhaustion and water-logging of the soil.</p>

<p>The next step is to estimate the duty and the discharge
of the canal and then to fix its main dimensions.
In Northern India the duty in the rabi is higher than
in the kharif. It may be 200 acres in the rabi and 100
acres in the kharif. Local circumstances determine
which crop has the greater area. Suppose that it is
estimated that both will be equal. Then the total
annual area for which water is to be provided must be
divided by two and this gives the kharif area. During the
kharif there is usually an ample supply of water and the
kharif mean supply of the canal is based on the kharif
area and the kharif duty. The full supply is not run all
through the crop because the demand fluctuates, the
demand being greatest when all the crops have been
sown and when there is no rain, but from experience of
other canals the ratio of the kharif full supply to the
kharif mean supply can be estimated. The ratio is
generally about 1&middot;25. On the kharif full supply depends
the size of the channel, every channel being constructed
so as to carry a certain &#8220;full supply&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page28">[28]</span>
or maximum discharge and the top of the bank
being made at such a height that there shall be a
sufficient margin or &#8220;free-board&#8221; above the &#8220;full supply
level.&#8221; The canal runs full provided that there is a
sufficient supply in the river or that the water level of
the river is high enough&mdash;this last condition referring
to canals which have no weir in the river&mdash;and provided
also that there is a sufficient &#8220;demand&#8221; for the water.
At other times a canal runs with less than full supply.
This generally occurs throughout most of the rabi,
the supply of water in the river being then restricted.
The distributaries are generally run full or &sup3;&#8260;&#8324;ths full,
some being closed, in turn, to give water to the others.
In the case of a country where there is only one crop
in the year, the average discharge of the canal can be
found by dividing the area by the estimated duty. The
F.S. discharge can be assumed to bear such a relation
to the average discharge as may be found by experience
to be suitable. On some Indian inundation canals the
F.S. discharge is taken as twice the average discharge.</p>

<p>The F.S. discharge of the canal having been arrived
at, the alignments of the canal and branches are next
sketched out on the contour plan and certain tracts and
discharges are assigned to each branch. The gradients
can be ascertained from the levels of the country and
the cross-section of the channel can then be sketched
out. If the velocity is too great for the soil &#8220;falls&#8221;
can be introduced. The above procedure will enable a
rough idea to be formed of the cost of the earthwork
of the scheme. The cost of the headworks and masonry
works and distributaries can be best estimated by
obtaining actual figures for existing works of similar
character, the distributaries being reckoned at so much<span class="pagenum" id="Page29">[29]</span>
per mile. The probable revenue which the canal will
bring in will depend upon the rate charged for the water
and the cost and maintenance, matters which can only be
determined by local considerations based on the figures
for existing canals.</p>

<p>The masonry works on a canal consist of the headworks
and of bridges, regulators and drainage crossings.
The principles of design for such works have been dealt
with in <i>River and Canal Engineering</i>. It is of course
economical to make a bridge and fall in one. If the off-take
of a distributary is anywhere in the neighbourhood
the fall should of course be downstream of it. The
positions of the falls should be fixed in accordance with
these considerations. If the longitudinal section is such
that the position of the fall cannot be much altered, it
may be feasible to divert a road so that the bridge may
be at the best site for the fall. In the case of a railway
crossing, a skew bridge is often necessary. In the case
of a road crossing it may be feasible to introduce curves
in the road but here also a skew bridge is often necessary.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="chapname"><span class="smcap">The Designing of a Canal.</span></span></h2>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref10">1. <b>Headworks.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&mdash;In the design of head works no very
precise rules can be laid down. Some general ideas can
however be given as to the chief points to be attended
to and some general and approximate rules stated. In
every case a large scale plan of the river is of course
required and also a close examination of it and study of
its character. An attempt to forecast its action is then
possible. Gauge readings for several years and calculations
of discharges are of course necessary. If the bed
of the river, in course of time, rises upstream of the
weir or scours downstream of it, a large amount of protection
to the bed and banks will become necessary.
Some description of headworks and weirs, with a plan
of the headworks of the Sirhind Canal, India, has been
given in <i>River and Canal Engineering</i>, <span class="smcap">Chapters IV.</span> and
<span class="smcap">X.</span> Remarks regarding the collection of information
for such works are given in <span class="smcap">Chapter</span> II. of the same
work. It is also explained how, by keeping the gates
of the under-sluices closed, a &#8220;pond&#8221; is formed between
the divide wall and the canal head so that heavy sand
deposits in the pond and does not enter the canal. By
closing the canal and opening the under-sluices the
deposit is scoured away.</p>

<p>The best site for the headworks of a canal depends on
the stability and general character of the bed of the
river but in deciding between any two proposed sites,
the question of the additional cost of the canal, if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page31">[31]</span>
upper site is adopted, has to be taken into account.
Such cost may, in rugged country, be considerable.</p>

<p>In the case of Indian perennial canals, the head is
often close to the hills where the river bed is of boulders
and shingle and fairly stable, but it is often at a distance
from the hills and in such cases a gradual rise in
the bed of the river, even in the absence of a weir, is
more probable than scour. Such a rise may necessitate
a raising of the crest of the weir and of the bed of the
canal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig5">
<img src="images/illo041.png" alt="Sketch" width="500" height="435" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 5.</p>
</div>

<p>In the general arrangement of a headworks a great
deal depends on local conditions. Sometimes the river
runs in a fairly straight and defined channel and the
weir can then be run straight across it. Sometimes, as
in the case of the Ganges Canal, there is a succession of
islands and various short weirs are required in the
different channels. At the heads of the Eastern and
Western Jumna Canals, the river, on issuing from the
hills, widens out (<a href="#Fig5">Fig. 5.</a>) and the weir is built obliquely<span class="pagenum" id="Page32">[32]</span>
and not in a straight line. Its crest is higher at the east
than at the west side. There are under-sluices at both
sides. The upstream end and west side of the island
are revetted. The old head of the Western Jumna
Canal, as shown in the figure, existed long before the
advent of the British, and a temporary weir, made of
gabions filled with stones, was constructed across the
river every year during the low water period and swept
away during the floods. To have carried the weir along
the line shown dotted, the head of the Western Jumna
Canal being of course brought up to it, would apparently
have been feasible and cheaper, but the off-take would
have been in shallow water because of the curve in the
river, and there would have been no current along the
face of the head regulator of the canal.</p>

<p>The level of the floor of the under-sluices is generally
about the same as that of the bed of the canal. The
sill&mdash;made to exclude shingle and sand as far as
possible&mdash;of the canal head regulator may be 3 feet
higher and the crest of the weir 6 to 9 feet higher. The
top of the weir shutters is 1 to 2&middot;5 feet above the F.S. level
of the canal which may be 5 feet or more above the bed
of the canal. If the weir is provided with falling
shutters the width of the waterway of the under-sluices
may be about &sup1;&#8260;&#8321;&#8322;th of the width of the waterway of the
weir alone, otherwise about &sup1;&#8260;&#8328;th.</p>

<p>In nearly all cases the weir has a flat top and flat
slopes both upstream and downstream. In a case where
the river bed is of sand, the depth of water on the crest
of the weir in floods may be 15 feet and the velocity 14
or 15 feet per second. The downstream slope of the
weir may be about 1 in 15, and the upstream slope 1<span class="pagenum" id="Page33">[33]</span>
in 6. Where the river bed is of boulders the velocity
may be still higher. The faces of the weir are usually of
hammer-dressed stone. A lock for the passage of rafts
is added if necessary.</p>

<p>Unless the banks of the river are high, it is necessary
to construct embankments to prevent the river water,
when headed up by the weir during the floods, from
spilling over the country with possible damage to the
canal. If the river has side channels they have to be
closed. The stream may also have to be trained, by
means of guide banks or spurs, so as to remain in one
channel and flow past the canal head and not form
shoals against it. Where the river is unstable, it may
shift its course so as to strike the weir obliquely and
this may cause excessive heading up at one side of the
weir. In such cases it is usual to divide the weir into
bays or sections, each about 500 feet long, by &#8220;divide
walls&#8221; running at right angles to the weir.</p>

<p>The free-board or height of the masonry walls and
tops of embankments above H.F. Level is about 5 feet.</p>

<p>The span of each opening in the under-sluices is
generally 20 to 35 feet. The piers may be 5 feet thick.
It is usual to make each alternate pier project upstream
further than the others so that long logs coming down
the river during floods, broadside on, may be swung
round and not be caught and held against the piers.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig6">Figs. 6</a> and <a href="#Fig6a">6<span class="smcapall">A</span></a> show the headworks of the Upper Chenab
Canal now under construction (<a href="#Page144"><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> IV.</a>) The site
is in a low flat plain, but no better site could be found.
The weir consists of 8 bays of 500 feet each. The
crest is 10 feet above the river bed and the falling<span class="pagenum" id="Page34">[34]</span>
shutters 6 feet high. The slopes are 1 in 6 and 1 in 15.
The bulk of the work is rubble masonry in lime. The
lower layer upstream of the crest is of puddle; upstream
of the second line of wells it is rubble masonry in half
sand and half lime; upstream of the lower line of wells
it is of dry stone and there is an intermediate layer of
rubble masonry in lime with the stones laid flat. Below<span class="pagenum" id="Page35">[35]</span>
the crest there is a wall of masonry 9 feet thick and on
the crest there are two strips of ashlar between which
the shutters lie when down. The extreme upstream
and downstream portions of the bed protection are of
dry stone and 4 feet thick while next to the weir are
concrete blocks 2 feet thick resting on dry stone. The
width of the crest is 14 feet, of the weir 140 feet, of the
protection 70 feet upstream and 110 feet downstream.<span class="pagenum" id="Page36">[36]</span>
The guide banks have tops 40 feet wide and 18 and 14
feet above the crest of the weir in the upstream and
downstream lengths respectively, the side slopes being
2 to 1 and the water slope being covered, up to H.W.
level, by dry stone pitching 4 feet thick. The left guide
bank runs upstream for 3,250 feet from the centre line
of the canal and the right 2000 feet from the line of
crest shutters. The under-sluices have 8 bays of 35 feet
each and the canal head regulator 36 openings of 6&middot;5
feet each, the large openings shown in the figure being
sub-divided. The crest of the weir is no less than 10
feet above the river bed and the shutters add 6 feet to
this. The floor of the under-sluices is 4 feet higher
than the river bed. There is thus ample allowance for
a possible rise in the river bed.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref9">2. <b>The Contour Map.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&mdash;The contour map, besides
showing the contours of the country to be irrigated and
of a strip of country, even if not to be irrigated, which
will be traversed by the main line, should show all its
main features, namely:&mdash;streams, drainages, railways,
roads, embankments, reservoirs, towns, villages, habitations,
and the boundaries of woods and cultivated lands.
It should also show the highest water levels in all
streams or existing canals. A map showing as many
as possible of the above features should be obtained and
lines of levels run for the contours. In doing this, the
points where the lines of levels cut or pass near to any
of the above features or boundary lines, should be noted.
It may be necessary to correct inaccuracies in the plan
or to supply defects in it. The greater the trouble
taken to do this the less will be the trouble experienced
later on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page37">[37]</span></p>

<p>The heights of the contour lines will, in very flat
country, have eventually to be only 1 foot apart. This
will necessitate running lines of levels half-a-mile apart
at the most, and preferably 2000 feet apart, the pegs in
each line being about 500 feet apart. In less flat
country the heights of the contour lines can be further
apart than 1 foot. Whatever distance apart is decided
on for them, the survey should be done once for all.
On one of the Indian canals in flat country, the lines
of levels were at first taken 5 miles apart, the branches
roughly aligned and then further surveys made. This
led to great expense and delay and the procedure has
not been repeated.</p>

<p>In making a contour survey, a base line, as centrally
situated and as long as possible, should be laid down,
with side lines parallel to it near the boundaries of the
tract. The cross lines at half-mile or other intervals
should then be laid down. Some of them may run out
beyond the side lines. Circuits of levels should be run
along the base line, the side lines and the two extreme
cross lines and be carefully checked. The remaining cross
lines should then be levelled. All the levels having
been shown on the map the contours should be sketched
in. The scale of the map for a large project may be two
inches to a mile. If it is likely that the survey will have
to be extended, it will be easier to do this by prolonging
the base line and running more cross lines, than by
prolonging each of the cross lines already surveyed.
This can be borne in mind when selecting the base line.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref2">3. <b>Alignments and Discharges.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&mdash;On the contour
map the proposed alignments of the canal, branches,
distributaries, and escapes, determined after careful<span class="pagenum" id="Page38">[38]</span>
consideration of all matters affecting them, are shown.
The tracts to be irrigated by each branch and each
distributary are now marked off, the &#8220;irrigation
boundaries&#8221; following approximately the valleys and
lines of drainage. Any large tracts of land which cannot
be irrigated are of course shown and are excluded.
Forests or other lands which are not to be irrigated
should be similarly dealt with, otherwise confusion is
likely to arise later. The commanded area dependent
on each distributary is now ascertained from the map.
A certain percentage being deducted for scattered
unculturable areas the culturable commanded areas are
obtained. The proportion to be irrigated (in India in the
kharif) having previously been decided, the number of
acres to be actually irrigated by each distributary is
arrived at.</p>

<p>The next step is to ascertain the <span class="nowrap">discharges.<a id="FNanchor9" href="#Footnote9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span> A
general duty for the whole canal having been estimated
by considering the actual figures for other canals the
full supply of the canal at its head is arrived at.
(<a href="#Ref5"><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> I, Art. 6</a>). In Northern India it will be the
kharif duty and kharif full supply. Since some water
is lost by absorption in the channels, the duty of the
water on a branch is higher than that of the whole
canal based on its head discharge, and the duty on a
distributary is higher still. In designing a canal, an
attempt has to be made to estimate the losses of water
in the main canal and branches, so that the duties of
the branches and distributaries may be estimated and<span class="pagenum" id="Page39">[39]</span>
the channels designed accordingly. On the Western
Jumna Canal the figures were estimated to be as

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote9"><a href="#FNanchor9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a>
In this Article and in the rest of this Chapter it is assumed that the canal
is a Northern Indian one. Any modifications necessary to suit canals in
other countries will readily suggest themselves.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The question of duty is one which if not carefully
considered, may cause some confusion. A canal and
branches, having been designed with certain assumed
duties and with discharges based on certain values of
N in Kutter&#8217;s co-efficient, have, let it be supposed, been
constructed to a greater or less extent. When the
time comes for constructing the distributaries, the
engineers concerned may have different ideas, based on
later experience, as regards the probable duty and the
most suitable value of N. If they design the distributaries
with a higher duty and a lower value of N, it is
obvious that they can provide more distributaries than
at first designed, or can increase their lengths. In either
case they would provide for an increased commanded
area. If they do not do this, they ought to adhere to
the values at first proposed, thus making the channels
larger than, according to their ideas, would be
necessary. These larger channels will be able to do
more irrigation, by an increase, not in the commanded<span class="pagenum" id="Page40">[40]</span>
area, but in the proportion of it which is irrigated. Any
other course would result in the canal carrying more
water than could presumably be used by the distributaries.
Again, the question how the assumed duty was
arrived at may need consideration. It may have been
arrived at by taking the duty figures of some existing
canal, based on discharge figures which were the result,
not of observed but of calculated discharges, and if the
calculations were based on a value of N which experience
has proved to be wrong, a correction is obviously
needed. Many mistakes of the kinds indicated above
have been made, not perhaps in the case of a project
which has been recently got up and is then quickly
carried out in its entirety, but in one which is carried
out slowly or after a long period has elapsed or in one
which consists of extensions of an existing system. So
great, however, is the elasticity of a channel&mdash;by which
is meant its capacity for adapting itself to varied discharges,
a small change in the depth of water causing
a great change in the discharge&mdash;and so considerable
has been the uncertainty as to the real duty to be
expected, that any mistakes made have not usually
resulted in any serious trouble.</p>

<p>It has been stated (<a href="#Ref6"><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> I, Art. 2</a>) that it is not
desirable to let one channel tail into another. In old
canals a distributary used sometimes, after running
parallel to a canal, to be brought back towards it and
tail into it. The advantage of this was that the
distributary had not to be made very small towards the
tail and that, if the demand abruptly ceased, the distributary
was not likely to breach. The principle was,
however, essentially bad. The lower part of the
distributary was obviously too near the canal and not<span class="pagenum" id="Page41">[41]</span>
centrally situated as regards the irrigated strip. The
portion at the extreme tail was superfluous. Again,
whatever volume of water was carried through the
distributary and back into the canal, was needlessly
detached instead of being kept in bulk. Moreover the
duty of water on such a distributary cannot be ascertained
without a tail gauge and the observation of
discharges at the tail. There are similar objections to
one distributary tailing into another. Each should be
separate and distinct.</p>

<p>A major distributary is one whose discharge is more
than 40 c. ft. per second. It may be as much as 250
c. ft. per second. A branch, as soon as it reaches a point
where its discharge becomes only 250 c. ft. per second
should be considered as a major distributary. A minor
distributary is one whose discharge is from 8 to 40 c. ft.
per second. A minor distributary is nearly always a
branch of a major distributary. There are instances of
&#8220;direct minors,&#8221; i.e., minors taking off from canals or
branches. Such a minor, unless its discharge is a large
fraction of that of the canal which supplies it&mdash;and this
can seldom be the case&mdash;is objectionable because the
petty native official who has to see to the regulation of
supplies can manipulate the supply easily and without
detection, and the number of persons irrigating from it
being small, he can make private arrangements with
them. On the Sidhnai Canal there are some half-dozen
distributaries each of which had one or two minors
which took off close to the head of the distributary.
The people who irrigated from the minors managed to
get the heads shifted and taken off direct from the canal,
on the ground that, the water level in the canal being
higher than in the distributary, there would be better<span class="pagenum" id="Page42">[42]</span>
command and less silt deposit. The irrigation on all
these minors ran up to a figure far in excess of what
had been intended, to the detriment of lands further
down the canal. The minor heads have all been retransferred
to the distributaries, the difficulty as to
command being got over, as it should have been at first,
by constructing weirs in the distributaries. The fall in
the water surface at the distributary head, i.e., the
difference between the water level in the canal and that
in the distributary downstream of its head but upstream
of the weir, is quite trifling or even inappreciable.</p>

<p>In some of the older Indian canals it was the custom
to place the heads of distributaries, not just above a
fall but several hundred feet above it, the idea being
that the distributary then received less silt. This
practice has now been discontinued. There is no valid
reason for following it.</p>

<p>The question whether, when a channel crosses a road
on the skew, a skew bridge should be constructed or
curves introduced into the road or channel, is one which
requires some consideration. As far as possible the lines
of channels should be fixed so as to cross <span class="nowrap">important<a id="FNanchor10"
href="#Footnote10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span>
roads on the square or with a small angle of skew. In
the case of main canals or branches, the introduction of
special curves is generally out of the question, but if
the road is not straight something can be done by
shifting the line one way or the other. In the case of
&#8220;major&#8221; distributaries, curves can to some extent be
introduced. In the case of &#8220;minor&#8221; distributaries it is
often possible to curve the channel, with a radius of say<span class="pagenum" id="Page43">[43]</span>
500 feet, so that it will cross the road at right angles.
There is very little objection to a skew bridge if the
angle of skew is not great. The angle of crossing having
been made as near to 90&deg; as possible, the bridge can be
made skew though not necessarily so much askew as
the road. Slight curves can be introduced into the
road. When the road is made askew, a bridge on the
square involves at least three considerable curves (<a href="#Fig7">Fig. 7</a>)
and the taking up of extra land. It also causes, in
perpetuity most likely, a more or less inconvenient and
unsightly arrangement and one which, in most countries,
would not be tolerated. When the angle of skew is not
great, it is best to introduce no curve at all into the
road. In the case of a &#8220;village&#8221; road, which may be
more or less undefined and liable to be shifted, the
difficulty about land may not be great, but even in this
case the angle of crossing should, if possible, be kept
near to 90&deg;, especially in the case of minors, and where
curves have to be introduced into the road they should
be suitable ones. Abrupt angles are not only unsightly
but are unfair to the cart drivers. The crossings of
village roads by the minors of a certain great modern
canal have been stigmatised as &#8220;hideous.&#8221; Indian
canals can afford to do work properly.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref11">4. <b>Remarks on Distributaries.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&mdash;Before a canal
system can be properly designed, it is necessary to
determine certain points in connection with the
working of the distributaries. A distributary is intended
to irrigate a certain kharif area. Its average kharif
supply is determined from the assumed kharif duty.
It generally runs full in the kharif but not always.
In a very dry tract such as the Montgomery district of
the Punjab, the demand is so great and so steady that a
distributary practically runs full through the greater
part of the kharif. In such a case the canal or branch
must be so designed that it can keep all distributaries
full at the same time. Its F.S. discharge will be the
sum of all the F.S. discharges of the distributaries plus
the losses of water by absorption.</p>

<p>But in other cases, especially if the rainfall is
considerable, a distributary does not require its full
supply, either all through the kharif or for long at a
time. An estimate must then be made of what it will
require. It may be estimated that its requirements
will be met if, during the period of greatest demand, it
is closed for two days out of a fortnight and receives
full supply for the remaining twelve days. In this
case, since the various distributaries need not all be
closed on the same days, the canal or branch can be so
designed that it will carry a full supply equal (after
deducting losses) to &#8310;&#8260;&#8327;ths of the aggregate full supplies
of the distributaries. In other cases the fraction may
be &sup3;&#8260;&#8324;ths. It is likely to be lower the greater the rainfall
of the district. Even in the case when the distributaries
run full through nearly the whole of the kharif, there
will be periods when they only run with about &sup3;&#8260;&#8324;ths full<span class="pagenum" id="Page45">[45]</span>
supply. If full supply were run at such times, many of
the outlets would discharge more water than was
required, the cultivators would partly close them, and
breaches in the banks of the distributary might result.
Thus the water level of a distributary must always be
so arranged that it will have a good &#8220;command&#8221; when
it is running with about three-fourths of the full supply
discharge. The water level with &sup3;&#8260;&#8324;ths full supply is
generally &middot;5 to &middot;75 feet below the full supply level but it
should be calculated in each case. Generally it will be
correct to make the water level, when &sup3;&#8260;&#8324; full supply is
run, about 1 foot above the high ground traversed by
the distributary, excluding any exceptionally high
portions of small area. A more exact method is given
in <a href="#Ref4">Art. 9</a>. The greater the proportion of the culturable
area which is to be irrigated, the less should be the
area of any high land which is excluded. The F.S.
levels of the distributaries at their off-takes must be
settled in accordance with the foregoing remarks, and
these F.S. levels must be entered on the plan. Neglect
to thus fix the F.S. levels of distributaries before
designing the canals has frequently led to trouble.</p>

<p>The head needed at a bifurcation in order to get the
supply into a branch or distributary is always small
unless the velocity is high. For a velocity of 3 feet per
second the head required is only about &middot;16 ft., for 2 ft.
per second &middot;1 ft.</p>

<p>On an Inundation Canal which has no weir across
the river, the mean supply downstream of the regulator
(which is built a few miles down the canal lest it should
be damaged by the shifting of the river) is, as has been
mentioned, about half the full supply. The command<span class="pagenum" id="Page46">[46]</span>
in such canals is not generally very good. A distributary
can often obtain only mean supply and it should be
designed so as to command the country when it is
carrying mean supply. A detailed description of
Inundation Canals in Northern India, is given in
<i>Punjab Rivers and Works</i>.</p>

<p>Let M, F, m, f, be the mean and full supply discharges
at the heads of a canal and of an average distributary
on it and let the number of distributaries be n. It has
been seen (<a href="#Ref7">Chap. I. Art. 6.</a>) that M = &middot;8F about. Let k
be the proportion of the supply lost by absorption in
canal and branches. Then n&nbsp;m&nbsp;= (1&nbsp;- k)&nbsp;M&nbsp;= &middot;8&nbsp;(1&nbsp;- k)&nbsp;F.
If the distributaries all run with full supplies&mdash;at the
time of greatest demand&mdash;for 4 days out of 5, then,</p>

<p class="formula">n&nbsp;f&nbsp;= 1&middot;25&nbsp;(1&nbsp;- k)&nbsp;F</p>

<p class="formula"><span class="horsplit"><span class="top">f</span><span class="bot">m</span></span>&nbsp;=
<span class="horsplit"><span class="top">1&middot;25</span><span class="bot">&middot;8</span></span>&nbsp;= 1&middot;56</p>

<p>Since k depends on the wetted area, it is not
likely to be so great for F as for M, but the
above gives a general idea of the ratio of the
full kharif discharge to the mean kharif discharge.
On a large canal the circumstances of the distributaries
will not all be similar. Some will run full for a greater
proportion of their time than others. They can be
divided into groups and the ratio of the full to the
mean supply calculated for each group. The mean
supply is, as above stated, obtained from the area to be
irrigated, and the duty as estimated at the distributary
head.</p>

<p>At one time a system was introduced of making
distributaries of large size with the idea of running
them for short periods. One reason given for abandoning<span class="pagenum" id="Page47">[47]</span>
this arrangement, was that there was a tendency to
run such a distributary for too long. This reason is
not very intelligible. It would be applicable to any
distributary which was not intended to be run without
cessation. The result would be that some other
distributary would be kept short of water and this would
imply extremely bad management. The chief reason
against such a distributary is the greater cost of its
construction. It would effect a saving of water. The
ratio of the discharge to the wetted area would be high,
though this would be to some extent neutralized by the
greater frequency of closures, since, when water is
admitted to a dry channel, the absorption is at first
great. There would also be some difficulty in the
distribution of the water because of the short period for
which it would remain open. It will be seen (<a href="#Ref8">Chapter
III. Art. 5</a>), that it is desirable to open and close
always at the same hour of the day. An ordinary
distributary might run for 11 days out of 14. One of
double the size could not conveniently be run for
5&sup1;&#8260;&#8322; days. A distributary can always be enlarged if
necessary, but if made too large it is extremely difficult
to make it smaller.</p>

<p>It was also, at one time, usual to make minors, when
there were several on a distributary, of large capacities
so that they ran in turns. The preceding remarks apply
to this case. The system has been abandoned.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref14">5. <b>Design of Canal and Branches.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&mdash;The apportioning
of discharges to the various channels having been
effected as described in <a href="#Ref9">Art. 2</a>, the designing of the
canal and branches is proceeded with. Rough longitudinal
sections of all the lines are prepared by means<span class="pagenum" id="Page48">[48]</span>
of the contour map, the ground levels being shown at
intervals of one foot&mdash;or whatever the vertical distance
between the contours may be&mdash;and the horizontal
distances obtained from the map by scaling.</p>

<p>On these longitudinal sections the lines proposed for
the bed and F.S. levels are shown reach by reach and
also the mean velocities and discharges.</p>

<p>The laws of silting and scouring and the principles
on which channels should be designed are fully gone
into in <i>River and Canal Engineering</i>. It is there
explained that, for a channel of depth D, there is a
certain critical velocity, V&#8320;, which just prevents the
deposit of the silt, consisting of heavy clay and fine
sand, found in Indian rivers&mdash;this silt enters the canal
in such immense quantities that the canal silt clearances
would be impossible if much of it was deposited in
the channels&mdash;that sand of grades heavier than <span class="bt">&middot;1</span> may
deposit in the head of a canal and well nigh threaten
its existence, that the clear water entering the canal
in winter may pick up and carry on some of the sand
but that proper steps for preventing the deposit in the
canal can be taken at the headworks. This last
question has been referred to in <a href="#Ref10">Art. 1</a>. The following
additional rules for designing canals in Northern
India are chiefly taken from those given by Kennedy in
the explanatory notes to his Hydraulic Diagrams,
which are in use in the Irrigation Branch in Northern
India.</p>

<ul class="rules1">

<li>(1) Near the hills where the bed is of shingle the
velocity may exceed V&#8320;. A few other soils will
stand 1&middot;1 V&#8320;.</li>

<li>(2) In ordinary channels any excess over V&#8320; will give<span class="pagenum" id="Page49">[49]</span>
much trouble lower down.</li>

<li>(3) In the first four or five miles of a distributary, V&#8320;
should be allowed and gradually be reduced to
&middot;85 V&#8320; at the tail, the gradient being reduced if
convenient, while a minor or branch distributary
should have less than V&#8320; at its off-take and still
less at the tail. The sand is drawn off by the
outlets and in the lower part of a distributary it
is often non-existent.</li>

<li>(4) If there is efficient silt trapping at the head of
the canal any figures arrived at by the preceding
rules should be multiplied by &middot;9.</li>

<li>(5) In the case of a canal having its head far from
the hills, the sand is finer and any figures arrived
at as above may be multiplied by, perhaps, about
&middot;75, but further experience is needed to decide
this.</li>

<li>(6) If the soil is very poor, especially if the depth of
water is more than 6 or 7 feet, the velocity
should be less than V&#8320;&mdash;say &middot;9 V&#8320;&mdash;so as not to
cause falling in of the banks. Depths of more
than 9 or 9&middot;5 feet should, as far as possible, be
avoided for the same reason.</li>

<li>(7) At a bifurcation, one branch channel may have
no raised sill, and, owing to its smaller depth, it
may draw off no surface water and get an
undue share of rolling sand. Its velocity should
be greater than V&#8320; and that of the other branch
be less than V&#8320;.</li>

<li id="Ref13">(8) At such a bifurcation it may be necessary, during<span class="pagenum" id="Page50">[50]</span>
times of low supply, to head up the water in the
main channel and some silt may temporarily be
deposited in it. When the heading up ceases,
the silt is scoured away but it mostly goes into
the branch whose bed level is the lower. It is
best to design such bifurcations so that the sill
levels of the two branches are equal and, if
possible, so that their bed levels are <span class="nowrap">equal.<a id="FNanchor11" href="#Footnote11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></span>
Otherwise the channel which is likely to get
most silt should have the steeper gradient.</li>

<li>(9) Any existing well established r&eacute;gime should not
be tampered with.</li>

<p>The actual gradients of the canals generally range
from about 1 in 8,000 for a main canal to 1 in 2,000 for
the tail of a distributary, but near the head of a canal
where the bed is of boulders and shingle, the gradient
may be as steep as 1 in <span class="nowrap">1,000.<a id="FNanchor12"
href="#Footnote12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span> The velocity in this
last case may be 5 feet per second but generally it is
not more than 3 or 4 feet per second in canals and
branches, and 1 to 2 feet per second in distributaries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page51">[51]</span></p>

<p>In designing the channels, N, in Kutter&#8217;s co-efficient,
may be taken as &middot;0225 or &middot;020, according to judgment.
For new and smooth channels &middot;020 is generally correct.
A channel generally becomes rougher by use but sometimes
it becomes smoother. Cases have occurred in
which N has been found to be &middot;016. This question is
discussed in <i>Hydraulics</i>, Chap. VI.</p>

<p>The bed width of a canal is reduced, where a
distributary takes off, in such a way that when the
canal and distributary are both running full, the depth
of water in the canal continues to be uniform and the
flow to be uniform. When the distributary is closed
there is heading up in the canal upstream of the off-take,
but not enough to make any appreciable difference
unless the capacity of the distributary is a large fraction
of that of the canal and even then no harm is likely
to result.</p>

<p>The preceding rules and principles being taken into
consideration, the channels are designed. The bed levels,
gradients and depths are so arranged as to give the
velocities suited to the soil and to maintain the proper
relation of depth to velocity. The bed width is arranged
so as to give the proper discharge. The full supply
level of the canal and branches has also to be so
arranged that it shall be higher, at each distributary
off-take, than the full supply level of the distributary.
It is desirable to be able to give a distributary its full
supply even when the canal is low. Generally the slope
of the country along any line is greater than would be
suitable for the bed, and &#8220;falls&#8221; are introduced. The
off-take of a distributary is generally just above a fall
and there is generally an ample margin between its<span class="pagenum" id="Page52">[52]</span>
F.S. level and that of the canal. The discharge of the
canal during the greater part of the rabi may be only
about half the full supply. This discharge should
be estimated and the water level corresponding
to it calculated and shown on the longitudinal section.
If possible the levels should be so arranged that even
with its least supply the water level in the canal will
enable full supply to be given to a distributary. If this
cannot otherwise be managed it may be necessary to
construct a regulator in the canal below the head of the
distributary so that, during low supplies, the water can
be headed up. It has been stated in <i>River and Canal
Engineering</i>, Chapter IV., that such heading up, if
temporary, is not at all likely to cause silt deposit in
the canal. The designing of the distributaries is not
proceeded with at this stage.</p>

<p>Since no irrigation is usually done directly from the
canal and branches, they are designed without any
particular connection between the level of the water
and that of the country traversed. Dangerously high
embankments are of course avoided as far as possible.
The bed is designed at such a level that the excavation
and embankment at any place will be, as nearly as
possible, equal. Land in India is cheap. When the
excavation exceeds the embankment the balance is
made into a spoil bank. When the excavation is less
than the embankment the balance is got from borrow-pits.</p>

<p>The side slopes of channels in excavation are generally
1 to 1, in embankment 1&sup1;&#8260;&#8322; to 1. The sides of channels
of small or moderate size usually become about &sup1;&#8260;&#8322; to 1,
or even vertical, by the deposit of silt on the slopes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page53">[53]</span>
This reduction of area is allowed for in the design i.e.
the bed width is so designed that the channel will carry
the required discharge, not with the side slopes as
executed, but when they have become &sup1;&#8260;&#8322; to 1. In large
canals however the sides do not always silt up but
rather tend to fall in. When this is expected to occur
the allowance above described is not made. Berms are
left so that if any part of the sides fall in, the bank will
not also fall in. The berms also allow of the channel
being widened if that ever becomes necessary. Type
sections are given in <a href="#Fig8">Figs. 8</a> and <a href="#Fig9">9</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent">The scale is 6 feet to an inch. The depth of water, in
this particular case, is 7 feet, and the bank, excluding
the small raised bank, 2 feet above the water. The
inside edge of the bank, where the small raised bank is
shown, is kept parallel to the canal for a considerable
distance. Its position is got by drawing a line, shown
dotted, at, generally, 1&sup1;&#8260;&#8322; to 1. The embanked part of
the slope is actually made at 1&sup1;&#8260;&#8322; to 1, but the
excavation is at 1 to 1, so that a berm is left. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page54">[54]</span>
width of this berm of course varies as the depth of
digging varies. If there is likely to be much falling in
of the sides the berm can be made wider, the dotted
line starting, not from the edge of the bed, but from a
point further in. On an inundation canal in sandy soil
the berm may be 20 feet wide. In figure 8, the inside
slope above the berm is supposed to have silted up to
a slope of 1 to 1. In cases where it is expected the
whole inside slope will silt to &sup1;&#8260;&#8322; to 1 the dotted line, to
give the edge of the bank, can be shifted towards the
channel so that the berm at the ground level when
the channel is excavated will be very small for the
minimum depth of digging. There is no need for the
inner edge of the bank to run parallel to the canal for
great distances. Its position can be shifted whenever
suitable and the width of the berm at ground level
varied. This prevents the occupation of a needlessly
great width of land. It used at one time to be not
unusual to make a bank with a berm on the land side,
similar to that formed by the spoil in <a href="#Fig8">Fig. 8</a>, but at
about the level of full supply in the canal. The principle
is not a good one. Salient angles are liable to be
worn away. If earth has to be added to a bank to
strengthen it, the whole can be widened or the rear slope
flattened. The roadway is shown 18 feet wide, which is
nearly the maximum. For the drainage of rain water it
has a transverse slope, away from the canal, of about 1 in
50. The small raised bank on the canal side is to give
safety to wheeled vehicles. It is provided on the patrol<span class="pagenum" id="Page55">[55]</span>
<span class="nowrap">bank<a id="FNanchor13" href="#Footnote13"
class="fnanchor">[13]</a></span> on main lines and places where there is much
traffic or where there is plenty of width of bank to spare.
When the ground level is, for a considerable distance,
above the proper bank level&mdash;which is at a fixed height
above the F.S. Level&mdash;so that the road and its side-drain
have to be cut out, much earthwork can be saved
by allowing them to be at a higher level and, in the case
at least of the non-patrol road, giving the road a reduced
width.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote13"><a href="#FNanchor13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a>
A canal has an unmetalled driving road&mdash;called the &#8220;patrol road&#8221;
or &#8220;inspection road&#8221; on one bank. This road is reserved for the use of
officials. Otherwise, it would soon be cut up and worn away, and the cost
of repairs would be excessive. The patrol road should be on that bank which
is, in the morning (the time when inspections are usually made) in the shade
of trees planted on the landward side. Trees are not usually planted near
the water edge as they are sometimes blown down. In Northern India the
canals generally flow in a southerly direction, so that the left bank is best
for the patrol bank. On the other bank there is a bridle road which is open
to the public. Near a rest house&mdash;unless there is a bridge actually at the
place&mdash;the patrol road should be on the same bank as the rest house. It can
if necessary cross at the first bridge. Frequently there is also on one or both
sides of the canal a &#8220;boundary road,&#8221; which is open to the public, along the
toe of the outer slope. Along a distributary there may be a boundary road
on one side. It is generally the only road which can take wheeled traffic,
and in this case it should be reserved for officials unless money is provided to
keep it always in repair. Officials have to be on tour for weeks or months
at a time, and in all weathers. Their baggage carts also have to precede and
follow them. Anything which facilitates their touring about and seeing
things for themselves is, in India, most desirable. At a watercourse
crossing the boundary road along a distributary should be taken by a curved
incline up on to the bank and down again. Thus not only is the cost of a
culvert saved, but any touring official who is driving obtains a view of the
channel which he cannot get from the boundary road.</p>

<p>In shallow digging, the plan of setting back the banks
(<a href="#Fig10">Fig. 10</a>) and letting silt deposit as shown by the dotted
lines, is one which should be followed much oftener than
it is. It not only gives eventually a very strong bank,
but it enables the borrow pits, from which the earth for
the banks is got, to be dug inside the banks. Outside
borrow pits, besides being a source of expense, owing to
compensation having to be paid to those in whose land<span class="pagenum" id="Page56">[56]</span>
they are dug, cause great areas of hollows which are not
only unsightly, but are often full of stagnant water and
are thus a fruitful source of mosquitoes and malaria.
Insufficient attention has hitherto been paid to this
matter.</p>

<p>In designing each reach of a canal or branch, type
cross sections should be drawn out for several different
depths of digging, <i>e.g.</i>, one for very shallow digging, <i>i.e.</i>,
where the bed is little, if at all, above the ground level,
one for deep digging where the ground is higher than
the water level, and one for the &#8220;balancing depth,&#8221;
where the area of the channel excavation is equal to the
earth required for the banks. In calculating the earthwork
the sectional area of the digging or of the embankment
is taken, whichever is the greater.</p>

<p>The proper width and height of bank for any channel
depends partly on the maximum depth of water in the
channel, and partly on the discharge. Given a depth of
water of say 8 feet, a breach will obviously be more
disastrous with a great volume of water than with a
small volume. The following statement gives some
figures suitable to the rather light and friable soils of
Northern India, but the question is largely one of
judgment. Generally a low and rather wide bank is
preferable to a higher and narrower one. If a road,
with or without the small raised bank next the canal, is
required, special widths can, of course, be arranged for.
A 14-foot bank is required for a driving road.</p>

<p>The spoil in <a href="#Fig8">Fig. 8</a> is shown at a different level from
the bank proper, as it should be to give a neat straight
edge to the bank. The width of the spoil may vary
every chain. In <a href="#Fig9">Fig. 9</a> the spoil is raised to avoid
taking up too much land. The spoil presents the best
appearance when its height is kept uniform for as long
a length as possible, the width varying according to
necessity, When the height has to be altered, the
change should be made by means of a short ramp.
When the spoil is higher than the road, gaps in it are
left at intervals so that rain water can pass away.
When the spoil is heavy for a very short length it can,
in order to avoid a short and unsightly heap, which
would result from the adoption of the section shown in
<a href="#Fig9">Fig. 9</a>, be placed as in
<a href="#Fig8">Fig. 8</a>, some of it being led askew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page58">[58]</span></p>

<p>The small channel shown outside the bank in <a href="#Fig8">Fig. 8</a>
is a watercourse for enabling trees to be grown. It has,
of course, to be graded, and it may be in cutting or in
embankment. If any silt clearances of the canal are
likely to be necessary, the watercourse must be set back
to allow room for the spoil. Such spoil, if sandy, is to
a large extent washed down or blown away and does
not accumulate to anything like the extent that would
be <span class="nowrap">expected.<a id="FNanchor14" href="#Footnote14"
class="fnanchor">[14]</a></span> Moreover the spoil can extend onto the
watercourse when the trees have grown big, and no
longer need watering. Outside the watercourse is
shown the boundary road and the land boundary pillar.
The small channel in <a href="#Fig9">Fig. 9</a> is a drain for rain water.
It can be used as a plantation watercourse if the water
is lifted.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote14"><a href="#FNanchor14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a>
This fact has been quoted (<i>The Pioneer Mail</i>, &#8220;Silt,&#8221; 8th March,
1913) as showing that the silt supposed to be cleared is not really cleared.
This may be the case to some extent, but shortage of spoil is little proof of it.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Where there is no spoil, some extra land, perhaps
20 feet on either bank, is usually taken up for getting
earth from for repairs.</p>

<h3 class="inline">7. <b>Trial Lines.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&mdash;The proposed lines of channel, determined
as explained in Art. 5 should next be laid down
on the ground. A line should consist of a number of
straight portions. The curves should not be put in.
Trial pits should be dug at intervals. Some defects in
the line may at once become apparent because the contour
map, owing chiefly to the lines of levels having been
taken a considerable distance apart, is not perfect. A
line may pass through a patch of very high or very low
ground or too near to some building or other object
with which it is desirable not to interfere. Alteration<span class="pagenum" id="Page59">[59]</span>
may be desirable at a drainage crossing or at the off-take
of a branch. The lines should be corrected where
necessary. Sometimes the corrections may be very considerable.
Allowance can be made for the alterations
which will occur when the curves are laid out. Where
there is doubt as to which line is the best, trial pits may
be dug to obtain further information regarding the soil.</p>

<p>The line should now be levelled, careful checks being
made, a longitudinal section of it prepared and the proposed
bed, bank and F.S. level shown. The ground
levels ascertained by levelling the line, are certain to disagree,
to some extent, with the contour lines. The
latter were got only by inference from the levels of
points in the survey lines, and they should be corrected
in accordance with the fresh levels now available. If
the line does not seem to be the best that can be got, a
fresh line can be marked on the plan and the above
procedure repeated.</p>

<h3 class="inline">8. <b>Final Line and Estimate.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&mdash;As soon as the best line
seems to have been found, a large scale plan of the
country along its course should be made by taking bearings
or off-sets from points in it to the various objects
and noting where the line cuts them. On this plan will be
shown the exact alignment, the curves being put in and
the straight portions slightly shifted where necessary
so that the line may pass at a proper distance from any
buildings or other objects. But before this procedure is
carried out, or while it is being carried out, the
estimate for the work can be prepared from the longitudinal
section already taken. Such a section is of
course amply sufficient for a &#8220;project estimate,&#8221; in
which only approximate figures are given, and it is quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page60">[60]</span>
near enough for any estimate. In the case of small
works which have often to be executed with great
promptitude, lamentable delays have occurred owing to
the engineer deferring the preparation of his estimate
till he had got the line exactly fixed. Moreover there
is a chance of the labour being thrown away in case the
sanctioning authority directs any change in the alignment
to be made.</p>

<p>In the case of a large scheme, a project estimate is
prepared. In this the earthwork and the area of land
to be occupied are calculated pretty accurately. Designs
and estimates are also prepared for the headworks and
for the chief regulators. For works of which there are
to be many of one type&mdash;bridges, falls, distributary
heads and small drainage syphons&mdash;the cost is arrived
at from lump sum figures, one drawing of each kind
being submitted as a type. The distributaries are
approximately estimated at mileage rates. In the case
of a small scheme everything is estimated in detail
except perhaps the distributaries or some of them.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref4">9. <b>Design of a Distributary.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&mdash;A distributary is a
canal in miniature and, like a canal, it may have
branches. It has masonry bridges, falls and drainage
syphons. It has, as already mentioned, a masonry
regulator at its head. At the off-take of any branch or
distributary there is a regulator in the head of the
branch. If the branch takes off a large proportion of
the water there is a double regulator. A distributary
gives off watercourses as a canal gives off distributaries.
The watercourses belong to the people and not to
Government and they are cleared and maintained by
the people. Each watercourse has a masonry head<span class="pagenum" id="Page61">[61]</span>
known as an &#8220;outlet&#8221; (<a href="#Fig11">Fig. 11</a>). The outlet is the
point where the water passes from the hands of Government
officials to those of the cultivators. The outlet
is of masonry and its opening is not adjustable but is
fixed in such a way that its discharge, when the distributary
is full, bears, as nearly as can be arranged, the
same ratio to the F.S. discharge of the distributary as
the area intended to be irrigated by the watercourse
bears to that intended to be irrigated by the distributary.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig11">
<img src="images/illo075.png" alt="Outlet" width="450" height="421" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 11.</p>
</div>

<p>The floor of the outlet is level with the bed of the
distributary. It thus draws off rolling sand which
might otherwise accumulate in the distributary. Small
outlets are made of earthenware pipes, about &middot;4 feet in
diameter, laid in concrete. Two pipes, or three, may
be laid side by side. If more than three would be required,
a masonry opening is adopted. The discharge
through an outlet, is generally 2 to 5 c. feet per
second per square foot of outlet area, and the head &middot;1
to &middot;5 feet.</p>

<p>For the tract of country allotted to any distributary,
a contour map is prepared on a fairly large scale, say 4<span class="pagenum" id="Page62">[62]</span>
inches to a mile. On the map the line is laid down
and a rough longitudinal section, showing the ground
level, is prepared as in the case of a canal.</p>

<p>It has already been stated (<a href="#Ref11">Art. 4</a>) that a distributary
is so designed that its water level, when three-fourths
of the full supply is run, shall be well above the level
of most of the ground along its course. In other words
it should have a good command. A good rule is to
allow a fall of &middot;5 feet from the level of the water in the
distributary to that in the watercourse, a slope of 1 in
4,000 for the water flowing along the watercourse, and
a fall of &middot;3 feet for the water at the tail of the watercourse
to the level of the ground. This last level is,
like the other ground levels, taken from the contour
map. This procedure, in short, consists in making the
water level of the watercourse at its head govern that
of the distributary, just as the water level in the distributary
at its head was made to govern that in the
canal.</p>

<p>The enlarged contour map of the distributary area
shows, among other things, the boundaries of the lands
belonging to each village. Generally a watercourse
supplies water to only one village. When, however, a
village is far from the distributary, its watercourse has
to pass for a long distance through other villages and
it would be wasteful of water to have two separate
watercourses. In such cases one watercourse may serve
two villages or more. When a village is near to the
distributary and its land extends for a long distance
parallel to the distributary, it may have several watercourses
for itself alone. A watercourse can generally
be most conveniently dug along the boundary line of
two villages, or there may be some other line which the
people particularly <span class="nowrap">desire.<a id="FNanchor15"
href="#Footnote15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></span> Subject to, or modified by,
these considerations a watercourse is designed to run on
high ground like a distributary.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote15"><a href="#FNanchor15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a>
They also frequently wish the &#8220;chak&#8221;&mdash;the area irrigated by a watercourse&mdash;so
arranged that two men who are &#8220;enemies&#8221; shall not be included in
the same &#8220;chak.&#8221; This condition can be complied with only up to a certain
point. Arrangements may be modified but not in such a way as to upset the
proper rules.</p>

<p class="fsize80">The scale is 1 inch to 2 miles. The contour lines at 1 foot intervals
are shown dotted, the roads by double lines. The line of the distributary,
in order to follow the ridge of the country, would have
gone more to the left of the plan near the village. The shifting of
the line to the right brings it nearer to the centre of the irrigated
tract&mdash;supposed to be the whole area shown&mdash;and enables a single
bridge to be built at the bifurcation of the two roads. Suitable lines
for main watercourses are shown in thin firm lines. It is assumed
that the command is sufficient to enable the watercourses to run off
at the considerable angles shown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page63">[63]</span></p>

<p>The great object is to reduce the total length of
channels, <i>i.e.</i>, minors and watercourses. No watercourse
can be allowed to run alongside of or near to
another. It may run alongside a canal or distributary
when really necessary to gain command but not otherwise.
The longer the watercourse the larger the chak.
The discharge of an outlet may be anything up to 4 or
5 c. feet per second. This limits the size of a chak. If
a chak is too big it can be split up or a minor can be
designed. Very small chaks are to be avoided, but it
is difficult to fix a minimum size. The irrigation
boundary of the distributary, as fixed in the project, is
shown on the map but in practice it will not be exactly
followed. For various reasons the boundaries of a
chak may run somewhat outside it or stop short of it.</p>

<p>Where a distributary gives off a minor and there is a
double regulator, watercourses should, as far as possible,
be taken off from one or other of the branch channels
and not from upstream of the double regulator. Otherwise,
irregularities are likely to occur, both of the
regulators being partially closed at the same time&mdash;a
thing which is never necessary in legitimate distribution
of the supply&mdash;in order to head up the water and
increase the discharges of the outlets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page64">[64]</span></p>

<p>A watercourse nearly always gives off branches and
generally a system of turns is arranged by the farmers
among themselves, each branch in turn taking the whole
discharge of the watercourse for a day or part of a day,
the other branches being closed by small dams of earth.
To irrigate a field alongside the watercourse a gap is cut
in its bank. For fields further away, smaller channels
run off from the watercourses at numerous points.
Several gaps and several field channels may be in flow
at one time, and there is a dam in the watercourse below
the lowest one.</p>

<p>Occasionally, on an old canal, one watercourse crosses
another, the lands irrigated being at different levels, but
such crossings do not often occur in systems of watercourses
laid out according to modern methods. They
are, however, quite legitimate.</p>

<p>The lines of the main watercourses are sketched on
the map, their irrigation boundaries shown on it, and
F.S. discharges allotted to them according to the areas
which are to be dependent on them. In order that this
may conveniently be done the &#8220;full supply duty&#8221; or
&#8220;full supply factor&#8221; for the distributary is obtained. It
bears the same ratio to the ordinary duty that the mean
supply bears to the full supply. The total of the F.S.
discharges of all the watercourses should, with an allowance
for loss by absorption in the distributary, be the
same as the F.S. discharge of the distributary. If the
results are very discrepant it shows that the sizes of the
outlets need revision. Possibly they may all be too
large.</p>

<p>In &#8220;colonization&#8221; schemes where a canal is constructed
to irrigate waste lands&mdash;which are the property<span class="pagenum" id="Page65">[65]</span>
of Government and which are divided into square blocks
and given out to colonists&mdash;Government has complete
control of the watercourse system, and can arrange it
exactly as desired, but in other cases landowners often
strenuously oppose the passage of watercourses through
their lands. Compulsory procedure according to legal
methods is tedious, but the practical rule is not to let
anyone have water until any watercourses which are to
pass through his land have been not only agreed to but
constructed.</p>

<p>In ordinary cases Government possesses no power as
to the precise line on which a watercourse is dug. It
fixes the site of the outlet and assigns certain land to it,
and sketches out the line of the watercourse. If the
people choose to alter the line they can do so, but great
alterations in the main watercourses are not generally
feasible.</p>

<p>The positions of the <span class="nowrap">outlets<a id="FNanchor16"
href="#Footnote16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></span> having been settled after
discussion with the cultivators, a table is prepared
showing the chainage of the outlets, the probable head
or difference between the F.S. level of the distributary
and of the watercourse, and the F.S. discharge. From
this the sizes of the outlets are calculated and shown in
another column. If the length of the outlet barrel is not
more than 5 or 6 times the diameter&mdash;in the case of a
barrel whose cross section is not round or square, the
mean diameter&mdash;the discharge can be calculated as for
a &#8220;short tube,&#8221; but if longer the formula for flow in pipes
should be used, allowance being, of course, made for the
head lost at the entrance. The outlets generally consist
at first of wooden &#8220;shoots&#8221; or long tubes, rectangular in
cross section. This is because, after they have been tested<span class="pagenum" id="Page66">[66]</span>
by a year or two years&#8217; working, the sizes nearly always
require adjustment and the cultivators often wish to
have the site shifted.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote16"><a href="#FNanchor16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a>
The positions can be slightly altered by the Engineers for any
sufficient reason.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig11a">
<img src="images/illo082.png" alt="Cistern" width="450" height="97" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 11.</p>
</div>

<p>The uncertainty as to the proper size of an outlet is
due to several causes. If the command is very good
there may be a clear fall from the outlet into the
watercourse. In this case the discharge depends only
on the depth of water in the distributary, and is known
pretty accurately. But ordinarily the outlet is submerged,
and its discharge depends on the difference
between the water levels in the distributary and in the
watercourse. The latter level is not fixed. The cultivators
can lower it, to an extent which depends chiefly
on the distance of the fields from the distributary, by
deepening or widening the watercourse. In this way
the discharge of the watercourse is increased except
when a dam is temporarily made in it for the purpose of
irrigating any comparatively high land. This uncertainty
as to the discharge can in some cases be got over by
building a cistern (<a href="#Fig11a">Fig. 11</a>). This has the same effect
as raising the level of the barrel, the real outlet being
no longer submerged, and the discharge depending on
the depth of the crest of the overfall below the water in
the distributary. But such cisterns add greatly to the
cost of an outlet, and they can only be adopted when
there is good command. A great cause of uncertainty
as to the proper size of an outlet is the variability of the
duty of the water on the watercourse. The soil may be
clayey or sandy, the watercourse may be short or long,
the crops grown may be ordinary ones or may be chiefly<span class="pagenum" id="Page67">[67]</span>
rice, which requires three or four times as much water
as most other crops, and the cultivators may be careful
or the opposite. Again, the people may, if the outlet
gives a plentiful supply, often keep it closed, but there
is no record of such closures nor would the people admit
that they occur. These causes may all operate in one
direction&mdash;on a whole distributary this cannot happen
to the same extent&mdash;and thus enormous differences in
duty may occur. There is no way of arriving at the
proper size for an outlet except trial. Observations of
the discharges of the outlets are of very limited use. The
discharge may vary according to the particular fields
being irrigated. Observations of discharges will be
useful in cases where the people complain, or when the
discharge is obviously much greater or much less than
intended and will in such cases enable temporary
adjustments to be made, but by placing a dam in a
watercourse and turning the water on to a high field
near its head the people can make it appear that the
discharge is only a fraction of what it should be.</p>

<p>On any distributary there are generally some watercourses
which have a poor command, the head at the
outlet being, say, &middot;1 ft. or even less. Probably the
irrigation is a good deal less than it should be. In
such cases the rules may be set aside and a liberal size
of outlet given. The size may be 2 or 3 times the
calculated size. There is no harm in this. The irrigation
cannot increase much. Similar cases frequently
occur on inundation canals especially near the heads of
canals or distributaries.</p>

<p>The construction of masonry outlets on a distributary
is not usually a final settlement of the matter. Further
adjustments become necessary. This matter will be
dealt with in <a href="#Page96"><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> III</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page68">[68]</span></p>

<p>On the older canals little or insufficient attention
was given to the question of the sizes of outlets. The
sizes were far too great and, as long as all the outlets
in a distributary remained open, water could not reach
the tail. The distributary used to be divided into two
or three reaches and the outlets in the upstream reaches
used to be closed periodically. The closures had to be
effected through the agency of native subordinates and
the system gave rise to corruption on a colossal scale.
The tail villages never obtained anything like their
proper share of water. The upper villages were over-watered
and the soil was often water-logged and
damaged. Moreover, even if all concerned had the
best intentions, it was impossible to stop all leakage in
the closed outlets, except by making earthen dams in
the watercourses, and great waste of water resulted
from this.</p>

<p>The water level of the distributary with &sup3;&#8260;&#8324; full supply,
designed so as to be at least &middot;5 ft. above the water level
in the watercourse heads&mdash;or to be 1 foot above high
ground if this simpler plan is adopted&mdash;is drawn on the
rough longitudinal section and also the line of F.S.,
falls being introduced where desirable and the gradients,
F.S. depths of water and widths of channels being
arranged, just as in the case of a canal, so as to give
the required discharges, velocities suited to the soil and
a suitable ratio of depth to velocity. The bed width of
a distributary decreases in whole numbers of feet. The
decrease occurs at outlets but not at every outlet. As
the channel becomes smaller its velocity becomes less
and this necessitates, according to the laws of silting
and scour, a reduced depth of water. The height and
width of the banks in the tail portion of a distributary<span class="pagenum" id="Page69">[69]</span>
should be made rather greater than elsewhere&mdash;regard
being had to the depth and volume of the water&mdash;so
that breaches may not occur when the demand abruptly
slackens. The longitudinal section of a distributary
should have horizontal lines for showing the following:</p>

<p>A specimen of a longitudinal section is shown in
<a href="#Fig12">Fig. 12</a>. It shows only a few of the above items. In
practice all would be shown, large sheets of paper being
used with all the lines and titles printed on them.</p>

<p>When a distributary is constructed the side slopes
are made 1 to 1 in excavation and 1&sup1;&#8260;&#8322; to 1 in embankment.
The sides usually silt up till they are &sup1;&#8260;&#8322; to 1 or
even vertical. The silting up to &sup1;&#8260;&#8322; to 1 is, as in the
case of a canal, allowed for in the designing. The
berms are left so that, if any part of the side falls in,
the bank will not also fall in. They also allow of
widening of the channel. The remarks made in Art. 6
regarding the design of banks, apply to distributaries,
especially large ones.</p>

<p>On a distributary there is seldom much spoil. Where
there is no spoil, a strip of land, outside the bank and
10 feet wide, can be taken up on either bank from
which to obtain earth for repairs. On a minor the
width of the strip is sometimes only 5 feet.</p>

<p>When a distributary passes through land which is
irrigated from wells, it frequently cuts through the
small watercourses which run from the well to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page71">[71]</span>
fields. In such cases, either a syphon or a supplementary
well is provided at Government cost. If several
watercourses, all from the same well, are cut through, it
is generally possible to combine them for the purpose of
the crossing. The wishes of the cultivators in this
matter are met as far as possible.</p>

<p>The procedure as regards laying out the line on the
ground, digging trial pits, correcting the line and preparing
the estimate are the same as for the case of a
canal.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref1">10. <b>Best System of Distributaries.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&mdash;Let AB (<a href="#Fig13">Fig. 13</a>)
represent a portion of a distributary, the irrigation boundary
CD being two miles from AB. In order to irrigate
a rectangular plot ACDB, the main and branch watercourses
would be arranged somewhat as shown by the
full and dotted lines respectively. Generally, the whole
supply of the main watercourse would be sent in turn
down each branch, the other branches being then dry.
The average length open is AGE. The ends of the
branches lie on a line drawn say 200 feet from the lines
BD and DC, since it is not necessary for the watercourses
to extend to the outside edges of the fields.
Within the field there are small field watercourses which<span class="pagenum" id="Page72">[72]</span>
extend to every part of it. By describing three rectangles
on AC, making AB greater than, equal to and
less than AC, it can be seen that the average length of
watercourse open is least&mdash;relatively to the area of
the block&mdash;when AB is equal to AC, i.e., when
the block served by the watercourse is square as in
the figure. If AB is 4 times AC, the average length
of watercourse open is increased&mdash;relatively to the area
of the block&mdash;in about the ratio of 3 to 2. Moderate
deviations from a square are of little consequence.</p>

<p>Suppose two parallel distributaries to be 4 miles
apart, each of them being an average Indian one, say
sixteen miles long with a gradient of one in 4,000, and
side slopes of &sup1;&#8260;&#8322; to 1, the bed width and depth of water
at the head being respectively 13&middot;5 feet and 2&middot;9 feet, and
at the tail 3 feet and 1 foot. The discharge of the
distributary, with N = &middot;0225, will be 72 c. ft. per second.
The discharge available for the 2 mile strip along one
bank will be 36 c. ft. per second. If the duty is 300
acres per c. ft. the area irrigated in this strip will be
10,800 acres, or 1,350 acres for each of the eight squares
like ACDB. Each main watercourse would then have
to discharge 4&middot;5 c. ft. per second. Supposing its gradient
to be 1 in 4,000 and its side slopes &sup1;&#8260;&#8322; to 1 and N to be
&middot;0225, its bed width would be 3 feet and depth of water
1&middot;45 feet. Its wet border would be 6&middot;3 feet, and its
average length 5280&#8730;2 + 5280 - 200 or 12,546 feet. Its
wetted area would be 79,040 square feet, and the total
wetted area of the 16 watercourses&mdash;on the two sides of
the distributary&mdash;would be 1,264,640 square feet. The
wetted border of the distributary itself is 19&middot;5 feet at
the head and 5 feet at the tail, average 12&middot;25 feet, and
its wetted area is 5,280 &times; 16 &times; 12&middot;25 or 1,034,880 square
feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page73">[73]</span></p>

<p>If the distributaries were two miles apart, there would
be twice the number of distributaries, and each square
would be one square mile instead of four. Each watercourse
would have to discharge 1&middot;125 c. ft. per second.
It would have a bed width of 2 ft., depth of water &middot;8 ft.,
wet border 3&middot;8 feet, length 6,173 feet, and wetted area
23,457 feet. The total wetted area of the 64 water
courses would be 1,501,248 square feet, or 18 per cent.
more than before. Each distributary would discharge
36 c. ft. per second, the bed width and depth at the
head being 10 feet and 2&middot;24 feet, and at the tail 2 feet
and &middot;75 feet. The wet border at the head and tail would
be 14&middot;5 and 3&middot;5 feet, mean 9 feet, and the wetted area of
the two distributaries would be 1,520,640 square feet or
50 per cent. more than before. Supposing that, in the
case of the larger distributary considered above, the
2-mile square was considered too large, and that rectangles
1 mile wide were adopted, so that the watercourses
were a mile apart, their number would be doubled
and their length and size reduced. Their total wetted
area would not be greatly affected, but the difference in
the wetted areas of the two small distributaries as compared
with the one large one, would be the same as
before. In practice, of course, distributaries are not
always parallel, nor are the blocks of irrigation all
squares, and frequently, owing to peculiarities in the
levels of the ground or the features of the country, or
the boundaries of villages, it is necessary to align the
watercourses in a particular manner, or to construct
more than one watercourse where one would otherwise
have sufficed, but the above calculations show in a
general way the advantages of large watercourses and of
not placing the distributaries too near together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page74">[74]</span></p>

<p>It is commonly said that a watercourse discharging
more than 4 or 5 c. ft. per second is objectionable
because the cultivators, if there are too many of them
on one watercourse, cannot organize themselves in order
to work it and keep it in order. This matter is much
exaggerated. On the inundation canals of the Punjab
a watercourse often discharges 10 c. ft. per second, and
is several miles long and requires heavy clearances, but
the people have no particular difficulty in managing it.
Kennedy, a great authority on questions of irrigation,
states that the length of a watercourse may be three
miles. This, if the angle made by a watercourse with
the distributary is 45&deg;, gives rather more than two miles
as the width of the strip to be irrigated.</p>

<p>Suppose that a distributary instead of being two miles
from each side of the irrigated strip, ran along one side
of it, and was four miles from the other side. If the
block were square, as before, the side of a square would
be 4 miles, and each watercourse would have to discharge
18 c. ft. per second, which is far too much. The blocks
would have to be rectangles, each being only one mile
wide measured parallel to the distributary. It has been
already seen that the length of watercourse in this case
is greater than when the block is square and each side
is two miles. Thus centrality in the alignment of the
distributary is an advantage.</p>

<p>A minor distributary has been defined (<a href="#Ref2"><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> II.,
Art. 3</a>) as being one discharging not more than 40 c. ft.
per second, but the term has come to be used to designate
a branch of a major distributary, and in that sense
it will be used in this article. When the shape of the
area commanded by a distributary is such that watercourses<span class="pagenum" id="Page75">[75]</span>
exceeding 2 miles in length would otherwise be
required, one or more minors are often added. Frequently
it is a question whether to let some of the
watercourses be more than two miles long, or to
construct a minor and thus shorten the watercourses to
perhaps only one mile. Which method is best has not
been definitely settled. It is known that the loss of
water in watercourses is heavy, but if a minor is added
the loss in it has to be considered. The loss must be
high in any channel in which the ratio of wet border to
sectional area is small. The minor also costs money in
construction and in maintenance. On the whole the
matter, as far as concerns cost and loss of water, is,
perhaps, almost evenly balanced, but as regards distribution
of the supply a system without minors is preferable.
The off-take of a minor is generally far from the
canal, i.e., in a more or less out-of-the-way place, and it
is impossible to see that the regulation is properly carried
out. Irregularities and corruption are sure to arise.
Even if the supply is fairly distributed as between the
minor and the distributary it is almost certain that the
regulator, if a double one, will be manipulated for the
illegal benefit of outlets in the distributary upstream of
the bifurcation. There are sure to be some such outlets
not very far distant. In any case each minor adds one,
if not two, to the already very large number of gauges
which have to be entered daily in the sub-divisional
officer&#8217;s register (<a href="#Ref12"><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> III., Art. 3</a>), and adds
also to the mileage of channel to be inspected and maintained.
These considerations should, in many cases,
though of course not in all, turn the scale against the
construction of a minor. At one time it became usual
to construct minors even when watercourses more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page76">[76]</span>
two miles long would not otherwise have resulted. This
custom was condemned some years ago, and is not
likely to be re-established. Most of the difficulties just
mentioned can, in the case of a minor which is not too
large, either absolutely or relatively to the main distributary
downstream of the off-take, be got over by making
the minor head like a watercourse outlet, building it up
to the proper size, removing the regulating apparatus
and abolishing the reading of the gauge, but in this case
the minor is not likely to be bigger than a large watercourse.
Such minors should not be constructed, and
any existing ones should, after the head has been treated
as above, be made over to the people and considered as
watercourses.</p>

<h3 class="inline">11. <b>Outlets.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&mdash;The top of the head and tail walls of
an outlet are level with the F.S. levels in the distributary
and watercourse respectively. The steps in the
head wall enable the cultivators to go down either to
stop up the outlet or to remove any obstruction. The
stepping is arranged so as to fall inside the side slope
ultimately proposed. It is usual, in some places, to
have the entrance to the &#8220;barrel&#8221; of the outlet made
of cast iron. The cast iron pieces are made of various
standard sizes. This to some extent prevents the
&#8220;barrel&#8221; being built to a wrong size. A discrepancy
between the size of the masonry barrel and that of the
iron would be noticed, but if the masonry barrel is built
too large the iron head does not always restrict the discharge.
The action is the same as in a &#8220;diverging
tube&#8221; well known in hydraulics.</p>

<p>For sizes up to about 50 or 60 square inches the
barrel should be nearly square. For larger sizes the<span class="pagenum" id="Page77">[77]</span>
height should exceed the width. Up to about 100 or
120 square inches the width can be kept down to 7 or 8
inches so that an ordinary brick can be laid across to
form the roof. For larger outlets the height can be
from 1&middot;5 to 3 times the width, and the roof can be made
of large bricks, concrete blocks or slabs of stone or of a
flat arch of brickwork or by corbelling, but in this last
case there should be two complete courses above the
top of the outlet. The less the width the cheaper the
roof, the easier the adjustment of size and the less the
tendency to silt deposit during low supplies. If pipes
are used they should be laid in concrete. If cast iron
head pieces are to be used there should be several sizes
of one width and the widths of the masonry outlets
should be made to suit these widths.</p>

<p>A masonry outlet is not generally built till the watercourse
has been sometime in use. The exact position
of the outlet should then be so fixed that the watercourse
shall run out straight or with a curve and should
not be crooked.</p>

<p>The width between parapets should be, for a driving
road or one to be made into such, 10 ft. (if the bank is
wider, it should be narrowed just at the outlet site) and
for a non-driving road, 8 feet to 3 feet according to the
ultimate width of the bank. Earth backing should be
most carefully put in and rammed, otherwise a breach
may occur and the outlet be destroyed.</p>

<p>Various attempts have been made to provide gates
or shutters for outlets. The chief result has been
trouble and increased cost. If grooves are made and
shutters provided, the shutters are soon broken or lost<span class="pagenum" id="Page78">[78]</span>
by the people. Hinged flap shutters are objectionable
because they are often closed by boys or by malicious
persons or by neighbours who wish to increase the
supply in their own outlet. The cultivator, when he
wishes to reduce the supply or to close the outlet, can
easily do this by obstructing the orifice with a piece of
wood or an earthenware vessel or a bundle of brushwood
or grass.</p>

<p>As regards temporary outlets, wooden outlets if large
(unless made of seasoned wood and therefore costly) are
liable to give great trouble. Water escapes round the
outside or through the joints. Pipes may do well if laid
in puddle but are brittle and costly if of large size. The
irrigators may interfere both with wooden outlets and
pipes and they are liable to be displaced or broken. A
temporary outlet, if small, can be made of bricks laid in
mud. The joints can be pointed with lime mortar.
When the outlet is made permanent the same bricks
are used again. But all kinds of temporary outlets are
liable to give trouble especially in light or sandy soil.
There is much to be said in favour of building masonry
outlets at the first, making a barrel only, <i>i.e.</i>, omitting
the head and tail walls and taking the chance of having
to alter the size. The alteration is not very expensive.
The head and tail walls are built when the size has
been finally settled. The adjustment can be made by
raising or lowering the roof. This should be done over
the whole length of the outlet but lowering can be done
temporarily over a length of 3 feet at the tail end of the
outlet. This can be done even when the distributary
is in flow. A reduction over a short length at the upstream
end of a barrel does not, as already remarked,
necessarily reduce the discharge much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page79">[79]</span></p>

<p>On inundation canals the rules regarding outlets have
to be modified. Great numbers of watercourses take
off directly from the canals. In such cases, especially
near the head of a canal, the ground to be watered is
often 5 to 8 feet above the canal bed and it is wholly
unsuitable to place the outlet at bed level. The cost of
the tail wall would be excessive. The floor level in such
cases must be at about the lowest probable cleared bed
level of the watercourse, say, in order to be safe, a foot
or half a foot below the usual cleared bed of the
watercourse, so that water need never be prevented
from entering the watercourse. The irrigators should
be consulted as to the floor level and their wishes
be attended to as far as possible. For lift outlets
the floor should be at the bed level of the canal
or distributary. If this bed is to be raised in the course
of remodelling, the floor should be at the old bed level
until the bed has actually been raised, unless there is a
weir which raises the water. It is necessary that lift
outlets should work however small the canal supply
may be. In a distributary or small canal, the head
wall should be built up to F.S. level but in a canal with
deep water the head wall should reach up to just above
the roof of the outlet and be submerged in high supplies.
The stepping of the head wall should be set back if the
channel is to be widened and should project into the
channel if the channel is to be narrowed. The centre
line of the channel near the outlet site must always be
laid down and the outlet built at right angles to it and
also at the correct distance from it.</p>

<p>Occasionally there is a wide berm, say 20 ft. or even
50 ft., between a channel and its bank. In such a case
the outlet should be built to suit the bank. The long<span class="pagenum" id="Page80">[80]</span>
open cut is however objectionable because the people
clear it and heap the spoil in Government land. Sometimes
the bank, especially if it is crooked, can be shifted
so as to come close to the channel at the outlet site.
Sometimes the outlets on inundation canals are large.
For outlets of more than 2&middot;5 square feet in area, grooves
should be provided so that the cultivators can use a
gate if necessary.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref16">12. <b>Masonry Works.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&mdash;The positions and descriptions
of all the masonry works of a proposed canal or distributary
are of course shown on the longitudinal section
of the channel and from this the discharges and water
levels are obtained. The principles of design to be
<span class="nowrap">followed<a id="FNanchor19" href="#Footnote19"
class="fnanchor">[19]</a></span> for bridges, weirs, falls, regulators and
syphons, are discussed in <i>River and Canal Engineering</i>.
It is mentioned that there is no special reason for making
the waterway of a regulator exactly the same as
that of the stream, and that the waterway may be such
as to give the maximum velocity considered desirable,
and that the foundations of a bridge should be made so
deep that it will be possible to add a floor, at a lower
level than the bed of the stream&mdash;with the upstream
and downstream pitching sloping up to the bed&mdash;so as
to increase the waterway and so save pulling down the
bridge in case the discharge of the channel is increased.
It remains to consider certain points affecting Irrigation
Canals.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote19"><a href="#FNanchor19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a>
So far as concerns their capacity for dealing with flowing water.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The span of a bridge, where there are no piers, is
generally made as shown by the dotted lines in <a href="#Fig14">Figure
14</a>, so that the mean width of waterway is the same as<span class="pagenum" id="Page81">[81]</span>
that of the channel. The arches, in Northern India,
used at one time to be 60&deg; as shown by the upper
curved line, but in recent years arches of 90&deg; as shown
by the lower curved line, have frequently been adopted,
the springing of the arch being below the F.S. level, so
that the stream is somewhat contracted. The 90&deg; arch
gives a reduced thickness and height of abutment. It
causes increased disturbance of the water, and this may
necessitate more downstream protection. An advantage
of having the springing not lower than the F.S. level is
that this admits of a raising of the F.S. level in case
the channel is remodelled, and this arrangement is still
common on distributaries.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig14">
<img src="images/illo097.png" alt="Bridge design" width="450" height="153" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 14.</p>
</div>

<p>When a fall and bridge are combined, the bridge is
placed below the fall as this gives a lower level for the
roadway. The side walls of the fall are produced downstream
to form those of the bridge.</p>

<p>The roads in India are generally unfenced and the
banks of canals close to bridges, on both sides of the
canal and both above and below the bridge, are generally
more or less worn down by cattle, which, when being
driven home in the evening and out to graze in the
morning, go down to the stream to drink. In order to
prevent this damage the banks are sometimes pitched,
above the bridge as well as below it, but the cattle
generally make a fresh &#8220;gh&aacute;t&#8221; further away. The best<span class="pagenum" id="Page82">[82]</span>
plan is to allow a &#8220;gh&aacute;t&#8221; on one bank either above or
below the bridge and to protect the other three places.</p>

kerbs and parapets of bridges respectively have been

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 15.</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#Fig15">Fig. 15</a> shows a head regulator for a distributary.
The scale is 10 feet to an inch. It has a double set of
grooves for the insertion of the planks with which the
regulation is effected. Only one set of grooves is ordinarily
used, but when the distributary has to be closed
for silt clearance and all leakage stopped, both sets of
grooves can be used and earth rammed in between the
two sets of planks. The floor is shown a foot lower
than the bed of the distributary. This reduces the
action of the water on the floor, and enables the bed of
the distributary to be lowered if ever the occasion for this
should arise. This is a good rule&mdash;in spite of the fact
that in re-modellings the tendency is for the beds to be
raised&mdash;for all regulators or bridges, a raised sill being<span class="pagenum" id="Page83">[83]</span>
added (in regulators) to reduce the length of the needles
or the number of the planks. Such sill should, where
needles are to be used, be fairly wide, especially if
regulation is to be done while the masonry is somewhat
new. The distributary shown has a bed width of 10 ft.
The span of the two openings in the head might have
been four feet each, but are actually five feet, and this
enables the distributary to be increased in size at any
time. The pitched portion of the channel tapers.
Unless needles are used, instead of horizontal planks,
spans are not usually greater than 5 or 6 feet. Longer
spans would give rise to difficulties in manipulating the
planks. Sometimes distributary heads are built skew,
but there is seldom or never any good reason for this.
A curve can always be introduced below the head to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page84">[84]</span>
the alignment the desired <span class="nowrap">direction.<a id="FNanchor22"

<p>Frequently the roadway of a bridge or small regulator
is carried, not on arches, but on steel beams. The
railings may be of wood or of gas pipe with the ends<span class="pagenum" id="Page85">[85]</span>
plugged, running through angle iron posts. In the case
of such a regulator the roadway is sometimes so light
that camels are not allowed to cross over. This causes
unnecessary hardship. Bridges are not too numerous.
If the regulation is done by gates, both road and platform
are carried on arches.</p>

<p>The regulators on inundation canals, and some on
perennial canals, are not strong enough to admit of the
flow of water being entirely stopped, so that the depth
of water would be perhaps 10 feet upstream and nil
downstream. This might cause the overturning of the
piers, or the formation of streams under the floor. In
such cases a maximum permissible heading up is decided
on. Such orders are, in India, liable to be lost sight of
in course of time, and they are, at least on inundation
canals, where sudden emergencies often occur, hardly
reasonable. An engine driver is not told that he must
never entirely close his throttle valve. Regulators
should be so designed that the water can be completely
shut off.</p>

<p>The following remarks show the chief points in favour
of needles and horizontal planks respectively.</p>

<div class="needleplanks">

<p><i>Advantages of Needles.</i> Needles can be placed or
removed by one man.</p>

<p>Needles do not require hooks, etc., which are liable
to be broken or lost.</p>

<p>A needle regulator requires few piers, and is
therefore cheap.</p>

<p>Water falling over planks throws a strain on the
floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page86">[86]</span></p>

<p>Regulation with needles is easy and rapid. A
jammed plank, especially if low down and not horizontal,
may give great trouble.</p>

<p><i>Advantages of Planks.</i> Floating rubbish is not
liable to collect above the Regulator because the
water flows over the planks.</p>

<p>By means of double grooves and earth filling,
leakage can be quite stopped.</p>

</div><!--needleplanks-->

<p>For large works the advantages are generally with
needles, but for small works, <i>e.g.</i> distributary heads and
shallow water, with planks. Needles 14 feet long are
not too long for trained men. Planks are more likely
than needles to arrest rolling sand, and this can be
taken into consideration in designing double regulators.
See <a href="#Ref13">number 8</a> of Kennedy&#8217;s rules, <a href="#Ref14">Article 5</a>. When
planks are used there should be two sets of grooves.
Planks are very suitable for escape heads which have
only occasionally to be opened, earth being filled in
between the two sets of planks.</p>

<p>Regarding notched falls, in the case of small distributaries
the notches are so narrow that they are
extremely liable to be obstructed either accidentally by
floating rubbish or wilfully by persons whose outlets are
upstream of them. Weirs are not open to this objection,
and are frequently adopted. There is not the least
chance of their causing any silting worth mentioning.
A simple weir if made of the proper height for the F.S.
discharge, will cause a slight heading up with &sup3;&#8260;&#8324;ths of
the F.S. discharge, and this unfairly benefits any outlets
for a considerable distance upstream of the weir. This
difficulty can be got over by making the weir as in
<a href="#Fig16a">Fig. 16<span class="smcapall">A</span></a>.</p>

<p>For cisterns below falls the usual rule for the depth is</p>

<p class="formula">K = H + &#8731;H &#8730;D</p>

<p class="noindent">where H is the depth of water in the upstream reach,
and D is the difference between the upstream and downstream
water levels. Another rule for distributaries is</p>

<p class="formula">K = <span class="horsplit"><span class="top">H + D</span><span class="bot">3</span></span></p>

<p class="noindent">the length of the cistern being 3 H and its width the
bed width of the channel.</p>

<p>At &#8220;incomplete&#8221; falls, i.e., where the tail water level
is above the crest, it is not unusual to construct a low-level
arch, which forms a syphon. The object is to
allay the surging of the surface water.</p>

<p>The question of skew bridges has been dealt with in
<a href="#Ref2">Art. 3</a>. Another question is that of the heights of
bridges. Irrigation channels, especially the smaller
ones, are very frequently at a high level, and bridges
have ramps which are expensive to make and to
maintain, and are inconvenient. The lowering of distributary
bridges in such cases, so that they become
syphons, or nearly so, has often been advocated and is
frequently desirable. The bed should slope down to the
floor and up again. The heading up can be reduced by
giving ample waterway, but it will not be necessary to
do this if there is head to spare. The fall in the water
surface can be recognised and shown on the longitudinal
section. The structure becomes one of the incomplete<span class="pagenum" id="Page88">[88]</span>
falls above described. The crown of the arch can, if
desirable, be kept above F.S. level, so that floating
rubbish will not accumulate.</p>

<p>The width between the parapets of a regulator can be
10 feet in the case of a driving road. It may be less,
according to the width of the bank, in other cases.</p>

<p>The upper layer of the floor of a bridge or regulator is
of brick on edge. Below this there is a layer of brick
laid flat, and below this, concrete of a thickness ranging
from &middot;5 feet to 3 feet. The thicknesses of piers range
from 1&middot;5 to 3 feet.</p>

<p>The bricks used for canal work in Northern India are
10 inches long, 4&#8311;&#8260;&#8328; inches wide, and 2&sup3;&#8260;&#8324; inches thick.
The thicknesses of walls are about &middot;83, 1&middot;25, 1&middot;7, 2&middot;1,
2&middot;5 feet, and so on.</p>

<p>The slopes of ramps should be about 3 in 100 for
district roads, and 5 in 100 for village roads.</p>

<p>Railings should be provided along the tops of high
walls and top of pitching near to public roads or canal
patrol roads. Bumping posts should be provided for all
parapets, and should not be so placed as to seriously
obstruct the roadway.</p>

<p>The quarters for the regulating staff should, when
convenient, be in the fork between the two principal
branches. They may be on the bank&mdash;with foundations
on pillars carried down to ground level&mdash;but not in such
a position as to obstruct the road or any road likely to
be made. Rests consisting of two parallel timbers bolted
to blocks of masonry reaching up a foot from the ground,
should be provided for the needles or planks. The bolt
head should be countersunk so as not to damage the
needles and planks when they are hurriedly laid down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page89">[89]</span></p>

<p>When two or more works are close together they
should be made to conform, and the whole site should
be considered with reference to a neat and suitable
arrangement of works, ramps and roadways. If an
outlet is near to a minor or distributary head the
parapets of the two should be in line. If two masonry
works of any kind are near together it is often suitable
to pitch the intervening space. If there are outlets or
distributaries on opposite banks they should be exactly
opposite each other. Where a road crosses a bridge or
regulator, the bank should be at the same level as the
road, the bank being gradually ramped back to its
original level. The space in front of any quarters should
have a slight slope for drainage, but otherwise be at one
level and be connected with the road or bank by proper
ramps. The berm or bank should be made at the exact
level of the top of any pitching or side wall which
adjoins it. Wing walls are frequently made too short,
so that the earth at their ends forms a steep slope and
is worn away, and the bank or roadway is cut into.
The walls should extend to such a point that the earth
at their ends cannot assume a slope steeper than the
slope of the bank.</p>

<p>It is obvious that for every masonry work there should
be a large scale site <span class="nowrap">plan<a id="FNanchor23"
href="#Footnote23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></span> showing all roads, ramps, and
adjoining works, both existing and proposed roads being
shown for some little distance from the work.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote23"><a href="#FNanchor23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a>
It is, or was until recently, in some parts of India, the custom to omit
the preparation of site plans, and to leave the fixing of the exact site of a
work and the arrangement of ramps and other details to the judgment of the
assistant engineer who was building it. Much unsightly work resulted. A
chief engineer in the Punjab recently issued some orders on the subject.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>For each kind of masonry work there is usually a type
design. A few of its dimensions, which are fixed, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page90">[90]</span>
marked on it. The other dimensions are variable. It
would be a great advantage to add to the design a
tabular statement to show how these dimensions should
vary under different circumstances.</p>

<h3 class="inline">13. <b>Pitching.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&nbsp;The object of pitching upstream of
bridges or regulators or downstream of bridges where
there may be little or no scouring action, may be partly
to protect the bank from damage by cattle or wear, or to
prevent sandy sides from falling in. In such cases there
may be pitching of the sides only, and it may be of brick
on edge laid dry and under this one brick flat resting on
rammed ballast (<a href="#Fig17">Fig. 17</a>). Downstream of regulators or
weirs and downstream of bridges if contracted or having
piers which cause a rush of water, especially if the soil is
soft, the side pitching may be as above, but with the
bricks over one-sixth of the area placed on end and
projecting for half their length. This &#8220;roughened
pitching&#8221; tends somewhat to reduce the eddying. The
bed protection should be solid concrete or blocks of
concrete or masonry. Immediately downstream of
regulators or weirs where there is great disturbance,
both side and bed pitching may consist of solid concrete
or of concrete or masonry blocks (<a href="#Fig18">Fig. 18</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page91">[91]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig19">
<img src="images/illo111a.png" alt="Toe wall" width="350" height="245" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 19.</p>
</div>

<p>Three kinds of toe walls are shown in <a href="#Fig17">Figures 17</a>,
<a href="#Fig19">19</a> and <a href="#Fig20">20</a>. The kind shown in <a href="#Fig19">Fig. 19</a> contains, for a
given depth below the bed, far more masonry than the
one shown in <a href="#Fig17">Fig. 17</a>. It is also liable to be displaced
and broken if scour occurs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig20">
<img src="images/illo111b.png" alt="Toe wall" width="350" height="209" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 20.</p>
</div>

<p>The earth should in all cases be carefully cut
to the proper slope, so that no made earth has
to be added. If the slope has already fallen in too
much, well rammed earth should be added. The flat
brick and rammed ballast can be varied as the work
proceeds, more being used in soft places and less in
hard.</p>

<p>In some parts of the Punjab, large bricks, the length,
breadth, and thickness being about twice the corresponding
dimensions of an ordinary brick, are made,
and are extremely useful and cheap for pitching. Where
the soil is sandy such bricks can be burned without
cracking.</p>

<p>Sometimes the curtain wall which runs across the bed
at the downstream end of the pitching is carried into the
banks and built up so as to form a profile wall (<a href="#Fig21">Fig. 21</a>).<span class="pagenum" id="Page92">[92]</span>
This is not very suitable, because the pitching of the
sides is apt to settle and leave the profile wall standing
out. It is better to lay a row of blocks on the slope. If
a hole tends to form in the bed downstream of the
curtain wall, blocks of masonry or concrete can be laid
and left to take up their own positions (<a href="#Fig22">Fig. 22</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig21">

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig22">
<img src="images/illo112b.png" alt="Curtain wall" width="500" height="224" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 22.</p>
</div>

<p>When scour of the bed or sides occurs downstream of
pitching, it is sometimes said that any extension of the
pitching downstream is followed by extension of the
scour. This may happen if the cross section of the
stream downstream of the pitched section has become
greater than the pitched section. In this case there is
eddying, due to abrupt enlargement of the stream where
the pitching ends. The increased width and lowered
bed level (not counting mere local hollows) of the stream
should be adhered to in the pitching. Where the
masonry of the regulator ends and the pitching begins,
there will be an abrupt or tapered enlargement, but the
eddies&mdash;at very low supplies there may be a fall&mdash;cannot
do harm.</p>

<p>This principle of enlarging the pitched cross section
can be followed, even in a new channel, if the soil is
light and scour is feared, and for this reason the matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page93">[93]</span>
is mentioned in the present Chapter instead of in
<a href="#Page96">Chapter III.</a> It was once the custom to splay out the
sides of a channel, downstream of a regulator or weir,
so as to form a sort of pool in which the eddies exhausted
themselves, but this gives curved banks and requires
extra land and is not a very convenient or neat
arrangement. Where scour of the sides is likely to
occur, or has occurred, immediately downstream of the
pitching the latter may be turned in as shown in
<a href="#Fig23">Fig. 23</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig23">
<img src="images/illo113.png" alt="Pitching" width="350" height="185" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 23.</p>
</div>

<p>Pitching has constantly to be replaced or extended
owing, generally, to failure to pitch a sufficient length
or to ram well the earth under the pitching, or to use
properly rammed ballast or flat brick, or to give proper
bed protection, or to the use of dry brick pitching when
a stronger kind is needed.</p>

<p>The side slopes of pitching should be 1 to 1. They
can be &sup1;&#8260;&#8322; to 1 in rare cases, <i>e.g.</i>, when there is no room
for 1 to 1, or in continuation of existing &sup1;&#8260;&#8322; to 1 pitching.
No absolute rule can be laid down as to the length to be
pitched, but in a Punjab distributary it is often about
5 times the bed width.</p>

<h3 class="inline">14. <b>Miscellaneous Items.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&nbsp;On Indian canals the
<span class="nowrap">chainage<a id="FNanchor24" href="#Footnote24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></span>
is marked at every thousand feet. Five<span class="pagenum" id="Page94">[94]</span>
thousand feet is called a &#8220;canal mile.&#8221; The distance
marks are often cast iron slabs, fixed in a cylindrical
block of brickwork about 2&middot;1 feet in diameter and 1&middot;5
feet high, the upper edge being rounded to a radius of
&middot;4 feet. The wedge-shaped bricks for these blocks are
specially moulded. The iron slab should project about
eight inches and have about a foot embedded in the
brickwork.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote24"><a href="#FNanchor24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a>
In India, instead of the simple word &#8220;chainage&#8221; the term &#8220;reduced
distance&#8221; is used. It is the distance reduced to a common starting point
as levels are reduced to mean sea level. The expression is puzzling to non-professionals
and new comers.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>On a canal having a wide bank the distance mark is
put at the outer edge of the patrol bank, earth being
added, if necessary, to increase the width. On a
distributary with a narrow bank the mark should be
on the opposite bank not the patrol bank. To enable
the miles to be easily distinguished the masonry block
can be sunk only &middot;5 foot in the ground, the others being
sunk a foot. In all cases the masonry block rests on a
pillar, 1&middot;7 feet square, of bricks laid in mud, carried
down to the ground level.</p>

<p>Profile walls (<a href="#Fig21">Fig. 21</a>, <a href="#Page92">page 92</a>) used occasionally
to be built at frequent intervals along a distributary.
They will not prevent scour occurring, if the stream is
tending to scour, unless very close together. Such
walls are of some use as showing whether the channel
is altering, but they are expensive and have to be
altered if, as often happens, the channel is remodelled.
It is a much better plan to lay down blocks&mdash;about 1&sup1;&#8260;&#8324;
foot cubes&mdash;of masonry or concrete, along the centre
line at every 500 feet, with their upper faces level with
the bed. If the bed scours they may be displaced but
otherwise they are useful not only for showing what
silt, if any, has deposited, but for showing the centre
line of the channel. Without them the centre line is
liable to be altered in silt clearances or berm cuttings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page95">[95]</span>
To enable a block to be readily found and to be replaced
in proper position if displaced, there should be two
small concrete pillars exactly opposite to it and
equidistant from it, one on either bank of the channel.
Such blocks and pillars may with advantage be placed
at quite short intervals on curves.</p>

<p>The rest houses for the use of officials on tour are
generally at intervals of about 8 to 14 miles. There is
generally a rest house near to a large regulator and
frequently there is one near to a small regulator. This
facilitates inspection work and discharge observations
and it saves money, because the house can be looked
after by one of the regulating staff. Not infrequently
the house is placed just too far away from the regulator.
Similarly if a rest house is near a railway station it
should be within a quarter of a mile of it&mdash;always
provided that this does not bring it too near to villages
or huts&mdash;and not a mile or more away as is sometimes
the case. It is also a mistake to place a rest house off
the line of channel unless perhaps when it is on a
district road which crosses the channel.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="chapname"><span class="smcap">The Working of a Canal.</span></span></h2>

<h3 class="inline">1. <b>Preliminary Remarks.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&nbsp;A large canal is under
a Superintending Engineer and it often constitutes his
sole charge. It consists generally of three to five
&#8220;divisions,&#8221; each under an Executive Engineer. A
division has two to four subdivisions, each under a Subdivisional
Officer. A subdivision is divided, for purpose
of engineering work and maintenance, into several,
generally three or four, sections, each consisting of some
20 miles of canal and some 40 miles of distributary, and
being in charge of a native overseer or suboverseer, and
for purposes of water distribution and revenue, into a
few sections each having, perhaps, some 30,000 acres of
irrigation and being in charge of a native zilladar. As
far as possible the boundaries of divisions and subdivisions
are co-terminous with those of the branches
of the canal. A distributary is always wholly within a
subdivision. At every regulator there is a gauge reader,
who, supplied when necessary with permanent assistants,
sees to the regulation of the supply. If there is a
telegraph office at the regulator the telegraph &#8220;signaller&#8221;
may have charge of the regulation. The zilladar has a
staff of some ten or twelve patwaris, who record in
books the fields watered and who are in touch with the
people and know when the demand for water is great,
moderate or small, and for what kind of crops it is
needed. In each division there is generally a Deputy
Collector who is a native official, ranking as a Subdivisional
Officer. His duty is to specially supervise<span class="pagenum" id="Page97">[97]</span>
the revenue staff in the whole division. Both he and
the Subdivisional Officer have magisterial powers which
are exercised in trying petty cases connected with the
canal.</p>

<p>Along a main canal and its branches there is nearly
always a &#8220;canal dak&#8221; or system of conveyance of bags
containing correspondence for the officials stationed on
the canal or touring along it. Along the main line,
and most of the way down the branches, there is a line
of telegraph for the special use of the canal officials.
The telegraph offices are at the chief regulators, with
tapping stations, for the use of officials on tour, at the
rest houses near to which the line runs.</p>

<p>However carefully a canal has been designed,
alterations in the channels from silting and scour soon
take place and they go on more or less without cessation.
In a distributary, especially if the gradient has of
necessity been made somewhat flat, there is quite likely
to be a deposit in the upper reach. The deposit is
generally greatest at the head and decreases, in going
downstream, at a fairly uniform rate. It may extend
for half-a-mile or less or more. Or a deposit may occur
on the sides, which grow out and contract the channel.
This often occurs over a great length of a distributary
or even over the whole of it. Sometimes a distributary
scours its bed, or the sides may fall in somewhat.
Clearances of the silt and cutting of the berms are
effected at intervals. Falling in of the sides may be
stopped by means of bushing, and scour of the bed may
be stopped by raising the crest of a fall or by introducing
a weir, but in the meantime the changes cause the
discharge tables for the distributary to become more or<span class="pagenum" id="Page98">[98]</span>
less erroneous. In many cases silt deposits in the
upper part of the distributary during the summer
months when the river water is heavily silted and scours
away again in the winter, the r&eacute;gime of the channel
being, on the whole, permanent. The changes which
occur in the branches and main canal are similar to the
above and the remedies adopted are similar. On some
of the older canals the scour was so serious that many
intermediate weirs had to be constructed. The remarkable
silting in the head reach of the Sirhind Canal has
been described in <i>River and Canal Engineering</i>,
Chapter V. The remedy consisted in keeping the gates
of the under-sluices properly closed so that a pond was
formed in which the river silt deposited. When
necessary the canal is closed, the sluices opened, and
the silt scoured away. For a plan of the headworks see
<a href="#Fig24">fig. 24.</a></p>

<p>In working a canal, it is necessary to arrange so that
the water sent down any channel is as nearly as possible
in accordance with the demand. The zilladar supplies
the Subdivisional Officer, every week or ten days, with
an &#8220;indent&#8221; showing how much water is required in
each distributary and the Subdivisional Officer makes
indents on the subdivision next above. The officer in
charge of the headworks thus knows what the demand
is. When it is more than the supply available, the
water is dealt out to the various divisions according to
rules approved of by the Superintending Engineer of
the canal.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig24">
<img src="images/illo119.png" alt="Map" width="600" height="375" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 24.</p>
<p class="largeillo"><a href="images/illo119lg.png">Large map</a> (59 kB)</p>
</div>

<p>Every gauge-reader has to be given definite instructions
as to the gauge reading to be maintained, until
further orders, in each distributary. At the places<span class="pagenum" id="Page99">[99]<br />[100]</span><a id="Page100"></a>
where the large branches take off, the gauge reader is
instructed what gauge to maintain in each. In the
event of too much water arriving, he turns the surplus
into the escape if there is one. If there is no escape he
has usually to raise the gauge readings of the branches
by equal amounts. By means of the telegraph, adjustment
is promptly effected at the headworks.</p>

<p>It has already been mentioned that rain may cause an
abrupt reduction in, or even cessation of the demand
for water. At the same time it increases the actual
supply. Rain, or the signs of rain, in any part of a
canal system ought always to be reported to the other
parts. Owing to changes in the channels, to fluctuation
in the water level of the river, especially during the
night, to rain or to changes in the temperature and
moisture of the air and to lack of continuous attention
on the part of the gauge reader, particularly at night,
there is a constant, though perhaps small, fluctuation
in the water level in all parts of a canal.</p>

<p>It may happen that&mdash;owing to enlargement of the
channels by scour, or to other causes&mdash;the channels of
a canal system are able to carry more water than was
intended. In such cases the channels are usually run
with as much as they can carry. This may give a
lavish supply and a lowered duty, but it increases the
irrigated area. To restrict the supply would cause loss
of revenue. Sometimes however, it is restricted to
prevent water-logging of the soil. The proper procedure
is to extend the canal to other tracts.</p>

<p>In India the farmers pay for the water, not according
to the volume used, but according to the area irrigated.
Different rates per acre are charged for different kinds<span class="pagenum" id="Page101">[101]</span>
of crops according to the varying amounts of water
which they are known to require. Sugarcane, which is
sown in the spring and stands for nearly a year before
being cut, thus extending over the whole of the kharif
and most of the rabi, is assessed at the highest rate.
Next comes rice which crop, though only four or five
months elapse between its sowing and reaping, requires
a great quantity of water. Gardens which receive
water all the year round also pay a high rate. Other
kharif crops are cotton and millet. The chief rabi crops
are wheat, barley and &#8220;gram.&#8221;</p>

<p>Every field irrigated is booked by a patwari who is
provided with a &#8220;field map&#8221; and &#8220;field book&#8221; for each
village (perhaps 6 or 8) in his beat. The map enables
him to recognise at a glance the field in which he is
standing. It has a number in the map and, by referring
to this number in the field book, he finds the area of the
field. The patwari is also provided with a &#8220;field
register&#8221; in which he books each field which is watered,
showing its area and the kind of crop grown, the date
of booking and the name of the owner and tenant. He
goes about entering up all new irrigation and his
proceedings are subjected to rigorous check by the
zilladar and Deputy Collector, and also by the engineering
staff. At the end of the crop the entries are
abstracted into a &#8220;demand statement&#8221; in which all the
fields cultivated by one person are brought together and,
the proper rates being applied to them, the sum payable
by this person is arrived at. The demand statement
goes to the Collector of the district, who levies the money
and pays it into the Treasury to the credit of the canal
concerned. There is a special charge for any land
watered in an &#8220;unauthorised manner.&#8221; This includes<span class="pagenum" id="Page102">[102]</span>
taking water when it was another man&#8217;s turn, or taking
it from an outlet which has been wilfully enlarged or&mdash;in
some districts&mdash;from another man&#8217;s outlet even
with his consent. The sizes of the outlets are carefully
apportioned to the land allotted to them and the area
which they irrigate is constantly being looked into in
order to see if the size is correct or needs altering. If
a man borrows water from another outlet such borrowing
may or may not come to light but in any case
confusion as to outlet sizes results.</p>

<p>The water rates charged for ordinary authorised
irrigation are decidedly low. In one district there was
a case in which a man, being unable to get as much
water as he needed from his own outlet, took water for
some fields, by permission, from a neighbour&#8217;s outlet.
This being found out he was charged for those fields at
double the usual rate. He continued regularly to use
the water and to pay the double rate. There were
several cases of this kind in that one district.</p>

<p>Since payment for the water is not made according
to the volume used, the cultivators are more or less
careless and wasteful in using it. As a rule they over-water
the land and frequently damage or spoil it by
water-logging. They do not always keep in proper
order the banks of the watercourses. The banks
often breach and water escapes. Any area thus
flooded is charged for if it is seen by an official. The
engineers have power to close such a watercourse until
it is put in order, but this would cause loss of revenue
and is not often done. The real remedy for all this is,
as already stated, rigid restriction of the supply. The
people will then learn&mdash;they are already learning&mdash;to
use water more economically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page103">[103]</span></p>

<p>When the crop in any field or part of a field fails to
come to maturity, the water rate on it is remitted. The
failed area is known, in the Punjab, as &#8220;khar&aacute;ba.&#8221; On
some canals the failed areas are liable to be large and
an irrigation register, in order to be complete, has to
show them or, what is the same thing, to show both the
gross and the net areas, the latter being the area left
after deducting the khar&aacute;ba or remitted area.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref23">2. <b>Gauges and Regulation.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&mdash;In every canal, branch
and major or minor distributary there is a &#8220;head gauge&#8221;
below the head regulator. At every double regulator
there is a gauge in each branch and also an upstream
gauge. These gauges are used for the regulation of the
supply. The zeros of the gauges are at the bed levels.
Tables are prepared showing the discharges corresponding
to each gauge reading&mdash;except in the case of
upstream gauges&mdash;at intervals of &middot;1 foot.</p>

<p>The question often arises whether it is necessary to
have a gauge near the tail of a distributary. If the
outlets have not been properly adjusted and if water
does not reach the tail in proper quantity, a tail gauge
is absolutely essential and its readings should be carefully
watched by the Sub-divisional Officer. To take no
action until complaints arise or until the irrigation
returns at the end of the crop show that some one has
suffered, is not correct. When it is known that
sufficient water always reaches the tail, a tail gauge is
not necessary.</p>

<p>There may be intermediate gauges on a canal or
branch or distributary. For convenience of reading
they are usually at places where a distributary or minor
takes off or where there is a rest house. They serve to<span class="pagenum" id="Page104">[104]</span>
show whether the water level at that place alters while
that at other places is stationary, and thus give
indications of any changes occurring in the channel.
The number of such intermediate gauges should be
rigorously kept down. In fact hardly any are necessary.
The gauge register which the Subdivisional Officer has
to inspect daily, is, in any case, voluminous enough.</p>

<p>At a double regulator it is never necessary, except as
a very temporary arrangement in case of an accident,
to partially close both channels at once. One or the
other should be fully open. The upstream gauge
reading shows whether this rule is being adhered to.
If the bed levels of all three channels at the regulator
are the same, the reading on one or other of the downstream
gauges should be about the same&mdash;for the fall in
the water passing through an open regulator is generally
negligible&mdash;as that of the upstream gauge. In other
cases the difference in the bed levels has to be taken
into account.</p>

<p>Immediately downstream of the off-take of a channel,
there is, unless the water flows in without any appreciable
fall, much oscillation of the water. For this reason
the gauge is frequently fixed some 500 feet down the
channel. This is anything but a good arrangement.
The gauge-reader&#8217;s quarters are close to the off-take and
he will not keep going down to the gauge. Moreover an
official coming along the main channel cannot see the
gauge. The gauge should be close to the head and in
a gauge well where oscillations of the water are reduced
to very small amounts. The upstream gauge requires
no <span class="nowrap">well.<a id="FNanchor25" href="#Footnote25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page105">[105]</span></p>

<p>All gauges should be observed daily, in the morning,
and the reports sent by canal dak, post or wire at the
earliest possible moment. This should be rigidly
enforced. The register should be posted and laid before
the Subdivisional Officer daily with the least possible
delay. It is only in this way that the Subdivisional Officer
can keep proper control of the water, and detect irregularities.
Sometimes trouble arises owing to the gauge
reports not coming in regularly. The suboverseer
can be made responsible for seeing to this matter as
regards all the gauge readers in his section. Gauge
readers often reduce the supply in a branch or distributary
at night for fear of a rise occurring in the night
and causing a breach. This is to save themselves the
trouble of watching at night. They are also bribed to
tamper with the supply and run more or less in any channel
or keep up the supply for a longer or shorter time. All
regulation should be rigorously checked by the suboverseer,
zilladar and Subdivisional Officer. Irregularities
can be speedily detected if proper steps are taken such
as going to the regulator unexpectedly. The watermarks
on the banks can also be seen. If any man is
found to have delayed entering a gauge reading in his
book or despatching the gauge report it is evidence of
an intention to deceive. The suboverseer or zilladar
should be required to enter in his note-book all the
checks he makes and the Subdivisional Officer should see
the entries and take suitable steps.</p>

<p>There was formerly a general order in the Punjab
that the Subdivisional Officer should write the gauge
register with his own hand. Such an order is not now
considered necessary nor has the Subdivisional Officer,
now-a-days, time to comply with it. The register<span class="pagenum" id="Page106">[106]</span>
should however be written by the clerk carefully and
neatly and not be made over to anyone else.</p>

<p>The regulation should usually be so effected that
rushes of water in any portion of the channel are avoided,
but if scour occurs in a particular part of the channel it
may be necessary to try and obtain slack water there.
Until it is proved by experience that they are
unnecessary, soundings should be taken periodically
downstream of large works. When a branch or escape
is closed the leakage should be carefully stopped. The
necessary materials should be always kept ready in
sufficient quantity.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref12">3. <b>Gauge Readings and Discharges.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&nbsp;For the head
gauge of each distributary and for certain gauges in the
canals, discharge tables, based on actual observations,
are prepared. If changes occur in the upper part of a
channel, the discharge corresponding to a given gauge
reading is altered. One remedy for this is to have a
second gauge downstream of the &#8220;silt wedge&#8221; or scoured
or narrowed reach. The indents are then made out with
reference to the second gauge, but any slight adjustments
due to fluctuation in the water level of the canal, are
effected by means of the head gauge. Unless the
zilladar and Subdivisional Officer are on the alert, the
gauge reader is likely to evade going to the lower gauge
every morning, and to enter fictitious readings for it,
inferring them from the readings of the head gauge. If
there are any outlets between the two gauges, their
discharge has to be observed or estimated and added to
the discharge of the distributary as entered in the table
corresponding to the readings on the second gauge.
The above system can be worked with advantage in<span class="pagenum" id="Page107">[107]</span>
cases where the distributary bifurcates two or three
miles from its off-take. The men in charge of the two
regulators can work together, one of them or an assistant,
going daily from one regulator to the other and back.</p>

<p>Usually, however, the vitiating of the discharge table
at the head gauge has to be faced, and the table to
be constantly corrected. It is impossible to frame
beforehand any rule or formula which would give a
certain correction for a certain depth of silt deposit.
Moreover, there might or might not be a contraction of
the channel due to deposit on the sides. The usual plan
is to observe a discharge some time during each month.
If the result is in excess of the tabular discharge, all the
discharges for that month are increased in the same
proportion. They can be booked according to the table
and totalled, and the correction applied to the total.</p>

<p>Discharges of canals and branches at their heads or
at the boundaries of divisions, are observed by the Subdivisional
Officer about once a month. Discharges of
distributaries are observed about once a month, usually
by zilladars. They are also to some extent observed by
the Subdivisional Officer, but much is left to his
discretion. Delta is worked out for each distributary
month by month, and also, of course, for each crop.
Thus a general duty &#8220;at distributary heads&#8221; can be
obtained, and may be used in new <span class="nowrap">projects<a id="FNanchor26"
href="#Footnote26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></span> instead of
the duty at the canal head, allowance being made for the
water lost by absorption in the canal and branches.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote26"><a href="#FNanchor26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a>
See <a href="#Ref3"><span class="smcap">Chap.</span> IV., Art. 2</a>.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>It cannot be said that these important figures are
obtained as carefully as they could be. If the Subdivisional
Officer personally observed the discharge at each<span class="pagenum" id="Page108">[108]</span>
distributary head, even every other month, the reliability
of the results would be much increased. In addition to
this the discharges of canals and branches at the
boundaries of subdivisions should be observed and the
results compared with the distributary discharges, so as
to show the loss by absorption. At first grave discrepancies
among the results would be found, but they
would be reduced as the causes of error became known.
For the method of investigating the causes of discrepant
discharges see <i>River and Canal Engineering</i>, <span class="smcap">Chap.</span> III.,
Art. 5.</p>

<p>A specimen of a Subdivisional Officer&#8217;s gauge register
is given in <a href="#Tab1">table I.</a> The zilladar keeps a similar register.
The columns headed G contain the gauge readings, those
headed D the discharges. Until some years ago there
were no columns for discharges. The daily discharges of
the canal and of the branches at their heads&mdash;and at
intermediate points if they were at the boundaries of
divisions&mdash;were entered in the Executive Engineer&#8217;s
office and the duty was worked out at the end of each
crop. The zilladar merely indented for a certain gauge
reading at the distributary head, and the Subdivisional
Officer could tell pretty nearly what gauge reading he
required in the canal at the beginning of his subdivision.
Since the year 1900 or thereabouts, the
zilladars have been required to learn a good deal about
discharges. They have to know how to observe the
discharge of a distributary, and to learn how the
discharge of an outlet varies with the head or difference
between the upstream and downstream water levels.
They are supposed to indent for certain discharges, and
not merely for certain gauge readings. All this knowledge
is useful to the zilladars and tends to increase
their efficiency, but a practice of constantly thinking in
discharges instead of in gauge readings is unnecessary.
If the channels were of all sorts of sizes matters would be
different. Actually the size of a channel is apportioned
to its work, and the proportion of its full supply which
it is carrying at any moment is easily grasped by means
of gauge readings alone.</p>

<p>As regards the weekly indents, the dealing with
discharges instead of gauge readings is of little practical
value. The zilladar merely knows that on some outlets
the demand is great, on others moderate, and he judges
that the distributary needs say, 4 feet of water, its full
supply gauge being 5 feet. He cannot tell how many
cubic feet each outlet requires. If he is required to
indent in cubic feet per second (he is not always required
to do this) he probably gets at the discharge from the
gauge reading, and not the gauge reading from the
discharge. As regards the general indent made by the
Subdivisional Officer, the same remarks apply. He can
probably tell what gauge he requires without going into
discharges.</p>

<p>Regarding the working out of delta month by month,
not only are discharges more or less doubtful, but the
area irrigated is seldom correct till near the end of the
crop. However, the figures, towards the end of a crop,
may be useful. If delta on any distributary is higher
than is usual on that distributary, it may be desirable, if
the supply in the whole canal is short, to reduce the
supply to that distributary somewhat, but this remedy
can be properly applied after the end of the crop by
altering the turns (<a href="#Ref8">Art. 5</a>). Any steps in the direction<span class="pagenum" id="Page111">[111]</span>
of altering outlets can only be taken after the end of the
crop. Admitting, however, that the working out of
delta during the crop is useful, it can be done by adding
up the gauge readings for the month and taking the
average reading and the discharge corresponding to it.
This is not quite the same as the average of the daily
discharges, but the difference is small, and there would
be a wholesale and most salutary saving in clerical work.
All the columns headed D could be omitted. The
handiness and compactness of the register would be
vastly increased. The discharges are only approximately
known, and refinements of procedure are unnecessary.
The correction of the discharge table, by means of
observed discharges, once a month, can of course be
effected without booking the daily <span class="nowrap">discharges.<a id="FNanchor27"
href="#Footnote27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote27"><a href="#FNanchor27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a>
There should, in any case, be a special place in the gauge register for
showing the discharge tables, with a note of the discharge observations from
which the table was framed or in consequence of which it was altered.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Supposing the columns D to be retained the calculations
of delta can be made as shown in <a href="#Tab2">table II.</a> the
form being printed in the gauge book. To facilitate the
adding up of the discharges a line can be left blank in
table I. after each ten days, and the total for the ten
days shown on it. If the column D is not retained, the
gauge readings can be added up. The discharge
corresponding to the mean gauge reading of the month,
multiplied by the number of days the distributary was
in flow, gives the figure to be entered in column 2 of
<a href="#Tab2">table II.</a></p>

<p>The final working out of delta crop by crop is of course
of the greatest value. The point which needs attention
is, as already remarked, greater accuracy in the discharges.
For reasons which have already been given (<a href="#Ref15"><span class="smcap">Chap.</span> I.,
Art. 5</a>, and <a href="#Ref4"><span class="smcap">Chap.</span> II., Art. 9</a>) the values of delta on
different distributaries will never be the same, but the
causes of high values can always be investigated and, to
some extent, remedied.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref19">4. <b>Registers of Irrigation and Outlets.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&nbsp;It is
obvious that a Subdivisional Officer cannot look
properly into matters connected with the working of his
channels unless he has, ready to hand, a register showing,
crop by crop, the area irrigated by each distributary and
each outlet and keeps it posted up to date. In 1888
the Chief Engineer of the Punjab Irrigation directed
that each Subdivisional Officer should keep up English
registers of irrigation by villages. The order was for
years lost sight of. The matter has lately, in view of
certain recent occurrences on a large perennial canal,
again come to notice, and this most essential factor in
the working of a canal is, it is believed, receiving
attention.</p>

<p>As to the precise form which an irrigation register
should take, opinions and practices differ somewhat. In
all cases the net irrigated areas should be shown&mdash;kharif,
rabi, and total&mdash;and the total remitted area.
The areas remitted for kharif and rabi separately may
or may not be shown. The net percentage of the commanded

be shown in red ink and is most <span class="nowrap">useful.<a id="FNanchor28" href="#Footnote28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></span> It
enables the general state of affairs on any outlet to be
seen at a glance and shows how it compares with other
outlets and with the whole distributary.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote28"><a href="#FNanchor28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a>
Provided that the culturable commanded area is properly shown and
is not made to include jungles or other tracts which were never intended to

</div><!--footnote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page114">[114]</span></p>

<p>Besides the irrigation figures it is necessary to record
for each outlet its chainage, size of <span class="nowrap">barrel<a id="FNanchor29"
href="#Footnote29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></span> and commanded
culturable area. In the case of a distributary
which has been working for years, and on which the
outlets are undergoing few alterations, it may be suitable
to record the above items in a separate &#8220;outlet register,&#8221;
and to give in the irrigation register a reference to the
page of the outlet register. But even in such a case
alterations will have to be made from time to time in
the outlet register and there is great danger of its
becoming spoilt, imperfect or unintelligible. In the
case of a distributary on which the outlets are undergoing
frequent changes, the items under consideration
should be shown crop by crop, and also the material of
the outlet&mdash;wood or masonry&mdash;and the width and mean
height of the barrel. In no other way can the working
of the outlet be properly followed and understood. It is
probable that this procedure is the best in every case,
<i>i.e.</i>, even when the alterations made are not frequent.
By arranging the register as shown in <a href="#Tab3">table III.</a>
the repetition of the entries, when they undergo no
alteration, is avoided, only dots having to be made.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote29"><a href="#FNanchor29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a>
The sizes of the outlets should be measured by the suboverseer and
some checked by the Subdivisional Officer and the correct sectional area, as
actually built, entered.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The <a href="#Tab3">specimen</a> shows only two outlets on a page, and
covers five years, but three outlets can easily be shown
on a large page, and the period can be seven years. If
there are more than three outlets in the village, the
lowest part of the page shows the total of the page
instead of the total of the village, and the other outlets
are shown on the next page, the grand total for the
village coming at the foot.</p>

<p>All the outlets of the uppermost village on the distributary
should be entered, first, even though some of
them may be downstream of, and bear serial numbers
lower than, the outlets of the next village. When one
outlet irrigates two or three villages the irrigation of
the separate villages can be entered on one page in the
places usually allotted to outlets, and the lowest part of
the page can show the total for the outlet, the necessary
changes in the headings, etc. being made. If any of
the villages has other outlets these will appear on
another page and the total for the village can also be
shown.</p>

<p>The village totals should be posted into a second
register prepared somewhat as shown in <a href="#Tab4">table IV.</a>
and totalled. The totals show the irrigation for the
whole <span class="nowrap">distributary.<a id="FNanchor30" href="#Footnote30"
class="fnanchor">[30]</a></span> If necessary the failed areas can
be shown in the register in red ink. If any village is
irrigated from two or more distributaries, each portion of
the village should be dealt with as if it was a separate
village.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote30"><a href="#FNanchor30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a>
Very long channels, e.g. inundation canals from which direct irrigation
takes place, can be divided into reaches and the irrigation of the reaches
dealt with as if they were separate channels. A reach should generally end
at a bifurcation or stopdam.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>In all registers some blank spaces should be left for
the insertion of new outlets or new villages. The
number of pages to be left will depend on local circumstances,
which should be considered. In case figures
are supplied by the revenue authorities and deal only
with whole villages, the details obtained by the canal
staff should always be added up and checked with them.
Similarly the commanded culturable areas for the
outlets and villages should be added up and checked
with the known total for the distributary.</p>

<p>The percentages of culturable commanded area
irrigated by different outlets will, as already explained,
always show discrepancies. Any special causes of low
percentages, e.g. a large proportion of rice, can be
briefly noted in the register.</p>

<p>On inundation canals, and some others, the alignment
and chainage are liable to undergo alteration. In such
cases it is best to adhere to the original chainage until
all the alterations in alignment have been carried out.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref8">5. <b>Distribution of Supply.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&nbsp;The question how the
supply of a canal is to be distributed when it is less than
the demand, is not always very simple. Suppose that
the main canal, after perhaps giving off several distributaries,
divides, at one place, into three branches,
A, B, and C, whose full supply discharges are respectively
2,500, 2,000 and 1,500 c. ft. per second. Suppose that
the total discharge reaching the trifurcation is expected
to be, when at the lowest during the crop, only 2,200
c. ft. per second, instead of 6,000. It would be possible,
supposing the discharge tables to be fairly accurate, to
keep all the channels running with discharges proportionate
to their full supplies, but this would not be
suitable. The water levels would not be high enough to
enable full supplies to be got into the distributaries, or
at least into some of them. Moreover, the running of
low supplies causes much loss by absorption. The plan
usually adopted is to give each channel full supply, or
nearly full supply, in turn, and for such a number of
days that the turn of each branch will recur about once
a fortnight, that being a suitable period having regard
to the exigencies of crops, and having the advantage
that the turn of each branch comes on a particular day<span class="pagenum" id="Page119">[119]</span>
of the week, so that everyone concerned, and especially
the irrigating community, can remember and understand
it. <a href="#Tab5">Table V.</a> shows how the turns in the above case
can be arranged. The figures show the discharges.</p>

<p>The orders given to the gauge readers in these cases
are simple, namely to give each branch full supply in
turn, and to send the rest of the water down the channel
next on the list.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page120">[120]</span></p>

<p>The number of days allotted to the larger branches
are greater than to the smallest because this will probably
be simplest in the end, and also because the
number of distributaries on a larger branch is likely to
be greater, and the allotment to the distributaries is thus
facilitated somewhat. Each branch receives water in
one period of consecutive days. Any splitting up of the
turn would be highly objectionable. It would cause
waste of water, and would give rise to much difficulty in
redistributing the supply among its distributaries. Each
branch receives its residuum turn before it receives its
full supply turn. The advantage of this is that water is
not let into the channel suddenly. The total supplies
of A, B and C are in the ratio of 13&middot;8, 10, and 7, and not,
as they should be 12&middot;8, 10&middot;3, and 7&middot;7,  but no closer
approximation can be got. If the number of days of full
supply allotted to each branch is changed, or if the
residuum from C is given to B, instead of A, the relative
total discharges differ still more from what they should
be.</p>

<p>If now the total supply is supposed to be increased to
2,700 c. ft. per second, the discharges are as shown in
<a href="#Tab6">table VI.</a></p>

<p>Considering both the above tables, A always receives
more water than its share, while B and C on the whole
receive too little. Considering table V. by itself, matters
might, perhaps, be set right by altering the total number
of days from 14 to 13 or 12, but this, besides being
somewhat objectionable for the reason already given,
might not improve matters when <a href="#Tab6">table VI.</a> came into
operation. It is desirable to avoid frequent changes or
complicated rules. It is objectionable to make any turn<span class="pagenum" id="Page121">[121]</span>
consist of other than a whole number of days. The
shifting of the regulator gates is begun at sunrise, a time
when officials are about and can see what is happening.
All gauges are read early in the morning, and those at
regulators are read after the regulation has been done
and the flow has become steady. If any regulation were
done in the evening, the entry in the gauge register of
that day would convey a wrong impression, and the
discharge would be incorrectly booked. Moreover, any<span class="pagenum" id="Page122">[122]</span>
system of regularly booking evening as well as morning
gauges leads to swelling of the already voluminous
gauge register.</p>

<p>The best method of adjusting matters is to make
slight alterations in the full supply gauges. Suppose
the normal full supplies in all three branches to be 6 feet.
When <a href="#Tab6">table VI.</a> is in operation the full supply of A can
be reduced to about 5&middot;8 feet. This would give, during
the first 5 days, less water to A and more to B, and there
is the further advantage that a very small supply, 200
c. ft. per second, is not run in any branch. As regards
<a href="#Tab5">table V.</a>, branch A never receives full supply. This is a
rare <span class="nowrap">case.<a id="FNanchor31" href="#Footnote31"
class="fnanchor">[31]</a></span> If it were safe, as it might be, to run slightly
more than full supply in C, this could be done, and it
would increase the supply in C during the last four days
and reduce that in A. Otherwise a certain gauge would
have to be fixed for A which would give it less than
2,200 c. ft. per second during the first 5 days, and the
balance would go to branch B. Similarly, the gauge of
B could be slightly reduced, and this would increase the
balance going to C. The orders given to the gauge
reader are, as before, to send the full supply down one
channel, and the balance to the next. The only
additional procedure necessary is to inform the gauge
reader from time to time what the full supply gauges
are. In any case such information has probably to be
conveyed to him at times because the channels undergo
changes, and the discharge corresponding to a given
gauge also changes.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote31"><a href="#FNanchor31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a>
The total discharge, 2,200 c. ft. per second, assumed, is very low
compared with the full supply of 6,000 c. ft. per second.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>When the discharge of the canal exceeds 3,500 c. ft.
per second there is, when B and C are receiving water, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page123">[123]</span>
second residuum, which goes to A. Tables can be
worked out for several discharges of the main canal, but
it is the minimum discharge which is the most important
factor in the case. The minimum discharge, or something
very near it, generally lasts through about half the crop,
and it is when the supply is at a minimum that care
and justice in the distribution are most needed.</p>

<p>The chief objection to the arrangements above
described is that the surplus to be sent down one
channel or another is sometimes so small that it must be
to a great extent wasted. The best means of preventing
this is to have the discharge tables, including one for the
main canal at some point higher up than the trifurcation,
constantly corrected. In that case, it is known under
what circumstances a small surplus will occur, and the
orders can be modified so as to prevent its occurrence.
The orders will of course be more complicated, and will
have to be dealt with by an engineer and not a gauge
reader.</p>

<p>The turns, once satisfactorily arranged, may go on for
years without alteration. They may require altering if
any branch is found, in the course of time, to be doing
worse than or better than the others, though the correction
can probably be made by altering the full supply
gauge.</p>

<p>The turns of the branches having been arranged, it
remains to settle those of the distributaries. The total
available discharge being, as before, assumed to be rather
more than one-third of the full supply discharge, each
distributary taking off from the main canal, where it is
not possible or not desirable to regulate the height of the
water level in the canal, can be run with full supply for<span class="pagenum" id="Page124">[124]</span>
four or five days out of each fortnight, and then closed.
Whether it be four days or five may often depend on
special circumstances such as whether the distributary
is doing well or otherwise. If necessary the full supply
can be adjusted. When the canal supply increases the
four or five days can be increased.</p>

<p>The same principle can be adopted for any distributary
whose off-take is in the upper part of a branch, <i>i.e.</i>, where
the branch is many times larger than the distributary,
and where it is not possible or not desirable to regulate
the water level of the branch. For a distributary further
down the branch, the turns of branch and distributary
can be arranged as explained above for a canal bifurcation.
The orders given to the gauge reader are, as before,
to give the channel whose turn it is, full supply and to
send the balance down the other channel. When the
turn of distributary is over it becomes the turn of the
branch. The distributary would not be closed if this
would cause the full supply in the branch to be exceeded.
Care must be taken that every distributary receives full
supply during part of the time when the branch is
receiving full supply. If its turn came only when the
branch was receiving a residuum supply, or rather when
the residuum supply was reaching the distributary off-take&mdash;for
in the case of a distributary whose off-take is
far down a long branch the two things are not the
same&mdash;it might, in the event of the supply in the
main canal falling exceptionally low, receive no water at
all.</p>

<p>The time taken by a rise in travelling down a canal is
very much the same as that taken by a fall and each takes
effect more or less gradually. When a branch receives,
at any point, a temporary increase in its supply, owing<span class="pagenum" id="Page125">[125]</span>
to the closure of a distributary for, say, three days, there
will be a rise lasting for three days at a point further
down. The rise will take some time to come to its
height, and some time to die away. There will be about
three days from the commencement of the rise to the
commencement of the fall, or from the end of the rise to
the end of the fall. If, either in the main canal or in a
branch, there is any distributary into which full supply
cannot be got, its turn can be increased accordingly.
Owing to the shortness of the turns, and to allowance
having to be made for the time occupied by rises and
falls in travelling down the branch, the fixing of the
turns for distributaries near the tail of the branch
requires a good deal of consideration. Matters are
facilitated by making a sketch (<a href="#Fig25">Fig. 25</a>) in which the
widths of the channels, as drawn, are roughly in proportion
to the full supply discharges. If 14 copies of the
sketch are made the arrangements for each day can be
shown on them, full supply being shown black and
residuum hatched. Distributaries would be shown as
well as the main channels.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig25">
<img src="images/illo145.png" alt="Sketch" width="350" height="260" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 25.</p>
</div>

<p>The irrigation registers of course show how the
irrigation of the different channels is going on from
year to year and if changes in the turns become necessary
they can be effected.</p>

<p>After the water has entered the watercourses the
canal officials have nothing to do with its distribution.<span class="pagenum" id="Page126">[126]</span>
The people arrange among themselves a system of turns,
each person taking the water for a certain number of
&#8220;pahars&#8221;&mdash;a pahar is a watch of three hours&mdash;or
fractions of a pahar. The zilladar can however be
called in by any person who has a dispute with his
neighbour. If the matter is not settled the person
aggrieved can lodge a formal complaint and a canal
officer then tries the case, and if necessary punishes the
offender.</p>

<p>In former days it was usual, in some places,
for no regular turns to be fixed for the distributaries,
orders being issued regarding them from time to time.
The weak point about any such plan is that in the event
of the controlling officer delaying, owing to any accident,
to issue an order, no one knows what to do. Orders
were also sometimes issued to zilladars giving them
discretionary powers in distribution. No one would
now issue such orders. The essential principle is to
remove power from the hands of the subordinates.
The working of the main channels by turns and the
construction of outlets of such a size that they never
require closure, has resulted&mdash;in places where such
matters are attended to&mdash;in the absolute destruction
of such <span class="nowrap">power.<a id="FNanchor32" href="#Footnote32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></span> The only way in which a zilladar
can injure anyone is to say that water is not
in demand. This would however result in damaging
the whole of the villages in his charge. He is not likely
to do this.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote32"><a href="#FNanchor32"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> In the printed form lately in use in the Punjab for reports on
zilladars, one of the questions asked is whether &#8220;his arrangements&#8221; for the
distribution of water are satisfactory, as if that was still considered to be the
zilladar&#8217;s business.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>In case the supply is wholly or partially interrupted
owing to a breach or an accident at the headworks, or
other cause, one particular branch or distributary may<span class="pagenum" id="Page127">[127]</span>
lose its turn or part of it. If its loss is not great it may
be best to allow the turns to take their usual course, but
otherwise they should be temporarily altered in such a
way as to compensate the channels which have suffered.</p>

<p>On inundation canals the water at a regulator is
sometimes headed up,&mdash;all branches being partially
closed&mdash;in order to give more water to outlets in the
upstream reach. There are even some regulators&mdash;or
rather stop-dams&mdash;constructed solely for this purpose at
places where there is no bifurcation of the canal or distributary.
Any such heading up should be planned out
beforehand and days for it fixed, and also the gauge
reading. If the water, without any heading up, rises to
the needful height on the gauge, nothing has to be done.
There are also places on inundation canals where the
land is high and is only irrigable during floods. At
such places it is usual, on some canals, to allow the
people to make cuts in the bank when the water attains
a certain height. Owing to the high level of the
country, nothing in the nature of a breach can occur.
In one canal division where the above arrangement was
in force, the people used to send applications to the
Executive Engineer for leave to cut the banks. This
resulted in much delay. A list was prepared showing
exactly where the banks might be cut, the people were
informed and the formalities were much reduced.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref5">6. <b>Extensions and Remodellings.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&nbsp;An existing
canal or distributary may need remodelling for various
reasons, and in various degrees. If the velocity is too
high and the bed has scoured, or the sides have fallen
in, it may be necessary to raise the crests of falls, or to
construct intermediate weirs, or to widen the channel
and reduce the depth. If the command is not good it<span class="pagenum" id="Page128">[128]</span>
may be necessary to regrade the channel. If silt
deposit occurs, the cross-section of the channel may
have to be altered, to give a better relation between D
and V. If there is surplus water, extensions or enlargements
of channels may be desirable and these can
sometimes be undertaken to a moderate extent merely
by restricting a somewhat too lavish supply to existing
distributaries. If the water level is dangerously high
it may have to be lowered, or the banks raised and
strengthened. Sometimes it is desirable to cut off
bends either to shorten the channel and gain command
or because the bends are sharp and cause falling in of
the banks or, if numerous, silting. In all cases the
general principles are the same as for entirely new projects,
but certain details require consideration.</p>

<p>The distributaries of the older canals were constructed
before Kennedy&#8217;s laws regarding silting were known,
and it has been necessary to remodel many of them.
In some cases the gradient was wrong, in others the
<span class="nowrap">cross-section.<a id="FNanchor33" href="#Footnote33"
class="fnanchor">[33]</a></span> In some cases a distributary ran in
rather low ground, and it was proposed to abandon it
and construct a new one on high ground. It was however
pointed out by Kennedy (<i>Punjab Irrigation Paper
No. 10</i>, &#8220;Remodelling of Distributaries on old Canals,&#8221;)
that irrigation had become established along the course
of the distributary, that most of it would remain there
and that a new alignment would result in increased
length of watercourses. Such distributaries have therefore
been allowed to remain very much as they were.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote33"><a href="#FNanchor33"><span class="label">[33]</span></a>
The difficulty of reducing the size of a channel which is too large is
well known and has been discussed in <i>River and Canal Engineering</i>,
Chapter VIII. It is there explained that a moderate reduction of width can
be effected by &#8220;bushing,&#8221; but that for great reductions, groynes or training
walls are necessary. When the bed of a distributary is too low it has been
suggested that it could be raised by filling in earth in each alternate length
of 500 feet, and leaving the rest to silt, but this would be expensive.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page129">[129]</span></p>

<p>Remodelling should not be considered piecemeal, but
regard should be had to the whole channel. When a
distributary is remodelled the outlets should of course
be dealt with as well as the channel. The chief thing
to consider is not whether the channel as it exists is
exactly as it was originally designed to be, but how it
is doing its work and what kind of alteration it needs.
Even when a simple silt clearance or berm cutting of a
channel has to be undertaken, the work need not always
consist in blindly restoring the channel to its original
condition. It may be both feasible and desirable to
remodel it to a slight extent, lowering the water for
instance in reaches where the outlets draw off very good
supplies and thus benefiting less fortunate reaches lower
down.</p>

<p>The irrigation boundaries of the extended or remodelled
channel should as far as possible follow
drainages, but these are not always important or pronounced.
The actual irrigation boundaries should be
shown and also those of any neighbouring channels of
other canals, and any suitable adjustments should be
made.</p>

<p>Regarding the percentage of area to be irrigated, it
has already been stated that one canal or distributary
irrigates a far higher percentage than another. Generally
when there is a high percentage in any tract, it is
undesirable to cut it down unless it has very recently
sprung up to the detriment of other tracts. In some
remodelling projects a uniform percentage is taken on
the whole area including both new and old irrigation.
This plan is suitable when the percentage of old irrigation
is not very high. In other cases the old irrigation<span class="pagenum" id="Page130">[130]</span>
to be provided for may be taken as the maximum area
actually irrigated, a little being perhaps added for
extensions. If the irrigation of considerable areas of
jungle tracts is contemplated and if these consist of
numerous small patches, a further percentage can be
added for them. If there are large jungle tracts they
can of course be dealt with separately and any suitable
percentage adopted for them. The percentage for each
portion of a remodelling project is not necessarily the
same.</p>

<p>If the discharge of a channel is increased, the waterways
of bridges may need increasing. This can often
be done (<a href="#Ref16">Chapter II., Art. 12</a>) by making a floor at a
low level. Or the waterway may be allowed to remain
small, the floor being added at the bed level and the
bridge then becoming an incomplete fall, (<a href="#Page87">page 87</a>). The
fall in the water surface, though small, can be recognised
and shown on the longitudinal section.</p>

<p>In remodelling schemes, the longitudinal section
should give all possible information. It should show
not only the levels of bed and banks, but the F.S. levels
(in blue figures) above and below all falls or regulators,
and the levels of floors and waterways of bridges. The
plan should show all watercourses and the &#8220;chaks&#8221; or
areas assigned to <span class="nowrap">them.<a id="FNanchor34" href="#Footnote34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></span> On each chak the actual
average irrigation can be shown in blue figures and the
proposed irrigation in red. The &#8220;draw-off&#8221; for each
proposed outlet can then be shown on the longitudinal
section. The area actually irrigated, as shown on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page131">[131]</span>
map, should in each case be the mean of at least three
years, and if possible of five years. The number of
years should be mentioned in a note on the map. Cross-sections
of channels should always be drawn to natural
scale, and not with the horizontal scale differing from
the vertical.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote34"><a href="#FNanchor34"><span class="label">[34]</span></a>
The field maps mentioned on <a href="#Page101">page 101</a> are prepared to a very large
scale and show all watercourses. The maps should always be corrected up
to date by the patwaris. The chak maps which are on a smaller scale&mdash;say
4 inches to the mile&mdash;can thus be kept correct.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref20">7. <b>Remodelling of outlets.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&nbsp;When a channel is
remodelled, the remodelling of the outlets may consist
in alterations of the number or sites or in alterations of
their sizes.</p>

<p>Regarding the former, a map should be prepared
showing all watercourses, chaks and <span class="nowrap">contours.<a
id="FNanchor35" href="#Footnote35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></span> On
this map new lines for the watercourses can be shown,
the principles enunciated in <a href="#Ref4">Chapter II., Art. 9</a>, being
generally followed, but in such a way as to utilise
existing watercourses and outlets as far as possible.
The work often consists in the abolition of a certain
number of watercourses, when these are too close
together and run parallel to one another. There may,
however, be little gain in amalgamating two such
watercourses if they serve two different villages. There
is nothing to prevent the people from dividing the
watercourse into two as soon as it gets away from the
canal, and they are likely to do this in many cases.
When one branch has a flatter slope than the other it
would lose command if it took off further down. The
people on the steeper branch might not agree to using
the flatter one because of silt trouble, or increased
height of embankment. In a new project it is not
difficult to get the people to do what is needed, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page132">[132]</span>
when once irrigation has become established it is often
difficult to get suitable changes made. The advantages
of amalgamating watercourses, though appreciable, have
been a good deal exaggerated. The chief advantage is
gained by reduction in the sizes of outlets. Then, however
many branches the watercourse may have, they can
only run in turns and not all together. It may
happen that two watercourses, though taking off near
one another, run in different directions and that the
chaks are of suitable shapes and sizes. In such a case
the only advantage of amalgamating is that it saves an
outlet in the canal bank. No saving in the length of
watercourse will be effected because there will be a
bifurcation as soon as the watercourse leaves the canal
boundary. If both outlets are of suitable design and
proper size or require only slight alteration, both can
remain but otherwise amalgamation can be effected. In
some cases amalgamation might give a discharge
greater than that usually allowed for an outlet but this
need form no obstacle. The chief reason for limiting
the discharge is the alleged inability of the farmers to
manage a large channel. This matter is exaggerated
as already stated (<a href="#Page74">page 74</a>). In the case under consideration
it obviously makes no difference whether
there are two watercourses each discharging 5 c. ft. per
second, or one discharging 10 c. ft. per second, and
immediately dividing into two. Very small watercourses
should, when possible, be joined to others but
if there is no other near enough they must generally
remain, however small they may be.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote35"><a href="#FNanchor35"><span class="label">[35]</span></a>
In small remodelling schemes the lines of existing watercourses show
how the country slopes, and a contour plan is not a necessity.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Regarding the alterations in sizes of outlets, whether
or not there are alterations in their number and position,
information as to the actual duties on the watercourses<span class="pagenum" id="Page133">[133]</span>
should be obtained. The discharge of the watercourses
should be observed several times and added up and
checked with the discharge of the distributary. The
areas irrigated are known from the irrigation register.
If the duties are abnormal the causes can be gone into,
and a judgement can be formed as to how far they will
remain in existence, and whether any watercourse is
often kept closed. If so the outlet is too large. The
duties, modified so far as may seem desirable, can be
used for calculating the sizes of the remodelled outlets.
But alterations of the sizes after a year or two years&#8217;
working will probably be necessary. The above procedure
is also applicable to a case where the old watercourses
had no masonry heads but were merely open cuts as on
some inundation canals.</p>

<p>A common case is that in which the channel is not
remodelled&mdash;or at least its water level remains very
much as before&mdash;but merely the outlets are altered in
number, position or size, or in any or all of these. If
the land irrigated by an outlet is high, the irrigation
may be far short of what was expected, and the size of
the outlet may have to be increased or its site shifted,
generally upstream. This is often done at the request
of the people, and at their <span class="nowrap">expense.<a id="FNanchor36" href="#Footnote36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote36"><a href="#FNanchor36"><span class="label">[36]</span></a>
On some of the more modern canals the people are not allowed to pay
for outlets, so that no question of ownership can arise.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Old outlets should always be removed when superseded
by others. Otherwise they are apt to be reopened
or claims set up regarding them.</p>

<p>Near the tail of a channel the discharge of an outlet
may be an appreciable fraction of that of the channel.
In such a case the adjustment of the size of the outlet, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page134">[134]</span>
that of the channel or of any weir or fall in the channel,
should be considered together, the irrigation on the outlet
and that on the channel downstream of it being compared.
And similarly as to the sizes of any two or more tail
outlets. Such outlets are sometimes left without
masonry heads on the ground that this injures no one.
It may injure an outlet upstream of them by drawing
down the water. Tail outlets often need constructing
or reducing in size to raise the water level in the reach
upstream of them.</p>

<p>Whenever the size of an old outlet is altered the
design should be altered if unsuitable. The parapets
should be brought into proper line, the roadway corrected,
the floor level adjusted and any splayed wing
walls abolished. If the outlet is skew it should be
made square. All this should also be done to all old
outlets or heads of minors even if the sizes are correct,
whenever remodelling of outlets on any channel is
<span class="nowrap">undertaken.<a id="FNanchor37" href="#Footnote37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote37"><a href="#FNanchor37"><span class="label">[37]</span></a>
Wherever an outlet is built or altered, a template, made to the
exact size of barrel required, should be supplied to the subordinate
in charge of the work.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>It was stated in <a href="#Page30">Chapter II.</a> that the construction of
masonry outlets on a distributary is not usually a final
settlement of the matter. In many cases a proper proportion
of water does not reach the tail. Even in such a case
matters have occasionally been left alone, or the old and
pernicious system of closing the upper outlets has been
resorted to. In such circumstances the irrigation of a
group of tail villages will be found to be less than that
of a group higher up, the people to some extent acquiescing
in the old idea that a tail village must be a sufferer.
Government, or at least the Irrigation Department, has<span class="pagenum" id="Page135">[135]</span>
no particular direct interest in the matter. The total
area irrigated, will probably be very much the same in
any case. But an engineer who takes an interest in
this part of his work will not allow matters to remain
long in the state described. He will, of his own accord,
adjust the outlets and equalise, as far as possible, the
irrigated percentages. The people will disturb matters
to some extent by enlarging watercourses, but there is
a limit to this and it can be met by an occasional
reduction of an outlet. A distributary, when once its
outlets have been carefully adjusted, attains to something
approaching perfection in its working. Any excess
in the supply is taken partly by the upper outlets but
part of it gets to the tail. Similarly any deficiency in
the supply is distributed over the channel. The outlets
which have a poor command and small head are most
affected in either case. On the whole they do not lose
or gain more than the others. The working of such a
distributary causes great satisfaction to the engineer
and not the least ingredient in this is the knowledge
that he has wholly destroyed the power of his native
subordinate.</p>

<p>In an inundation canal division in the Punjab, some
dozen distributaries, varying in length from 5 to 28
miles, and with discharges ranging up to 300 c. feet per
second, were dealt with as above in one season. The
engineer in charge being specially desirous that sufficient
water should reach the tails, reduced the sizes of some
outlets too much. When an outlet of 1 or 2 sq. feet
has to be reduced to a small fraction of its size it is not
easy to say what the fraction shall be. Water reached
the tails of all the channels in sufficient quantity, in
some cases in rather more quantity than was necessary.<span class="pagenum" id="Page136">[136]</span>
When the irrigation register was examined, it was
found that the general results were entirely satisfactory.
In a small proportion of cases outlets had irrigated too
little and had to be re-enlarged somewhat. After a
second season hardly any changes were needed. When
any silt clearance or berm-cutting seemed necessary the
irrigation register again came into play. If, for instance
the tail outlets, as a whole, were receiving too little
water, enlargement of the upstream reaches was effected
with consequent lowering of the water level there.</p>

<p>In the case above described the channels flowed for
only five months in the year. Some of them silted a
good deal but as this silting was roughly the same every
year, it did not greatly affect the question of outlet
sizes. On a perennial distributary of which the head
reach silts during part of the year and scours during the
other part, a proper distribution of supply by adjustment
of outlet sizes alone may be more difficult. If the silt
was frequently cleared, this would cause needless expense
and interference with irrigation. In cases where the
distributary is not run constantly, something can be done
by attending to the regulation. When there is silt in
the head reach, the discharge can be reduced and the
period of flow proportionately increased. The lowered
water level reduces the supplies of the upper outlets,
and increases the discharges of those lower down.
Moreover the periodical silting and scour are not always
serious. Also it is not essential that the supply to each
watercourse should be exactly the same every year.
There are always good and bad seasons. It is sufficient
if a watercourse is not allowed to suffer on the whole,
and is never allowed to suffer much. There is no doubt
that it is possible to deal satisfactorily in the above<span class="pagenum" id="Page137">[137]</span>
manner with very many distributaries. It is frequently
reported that &#8220;difficulty is experienced in getting water
to the tail.&#8221; This is owing to timidity in reducing the
sizes of outlets. The suitable plan is to reduce them to
such an extent as to cause a proper supply to reach the
tail and then, if necessary to enlarge some. It has been
already remarked that only a short length of the barrel
need be altered. The cost of this is very small. The
real difficulty in the case is not the impossibility of
securing good results, but the impracticability, in many
cases, of securing the constant attention which the
procedure <span class="nowrap">demands.<a id="FNanchor38" href="#Footnote38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="inline">8. <b>Miscellaneous Items.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&nbsp;At the headworks of a
canal there is a permanent staff of men who work the
gates and look after the works. They assist in discharge
observations and in reading the gauges, and they may
have to take soundings in the river to see what changes
are taking place. Some one is on watch day and night
and reads the gauges at frequent intervals. The officer
in charge occasionally inspects the works at night
without notice. Detailed rules regarding the above
matters, and any others that are necessary owing to
special local conditions, are drawn up. Sometimes there
is difficulty in getting the staff to attend properly to the
regulation of the supply in the canal at night. Probably
some &#8220;tell-tale&#8221; watches would be useful. They would
at least show the times at which the men concerned
went to the gauges or other points.</p>

<p>At the headworks, and at all important regulators, a
stock of concrete blocks should be kept ready for the
execution of any urgent repairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page138">[138]</span></p>

<p>Regarding the ordinary maintenance work on the
channels, details are given in <a href="#Page171">Appendices B</a> and <a href="#Page174">C</a>.
<a href="#Page175">Appendix D</a>, reprinted from <i>Punjab Rivers and Works</i>,
contains rules for watching and protecting any banks or
embankments which require it.</p>

<p>Silt clearances and berm cutting of channels have
been mentioned in <a href="#Page96">Art. 1</a>. Special attention should
be given to the accurate ranging of the centre line.
Otherwise the channel may become crooked. The great
defect in the earthwork ordinarily met with in the
banks of canals and distributaries is that the clods are
not broken. In consequence of this new banks are
extremely liable to breach, and much trouble and expense
result. Sometimes a dam is thrown across a new
distributary, and the channel upstream of it is gradually
filled with water, the bank being watched and leakages
made good. The dam is then shifted to a place further
down. In this way the banks are consolidated.</p>

<p>When a distributary is closed for silt clearance or
other work, if the head regulator has planks and a double
set of grooves, it is possible to stop all leakage by filling
in earth between the two sets of planks and ramming it,
but otherwise it is necessary to construct an earthen dam
just below the regulator. Upstream of the dam the water,
owing to the leakage through the planks, gates or needles,
rises to the same level as the water in the canal. Native
subordinates have a remarkable aptitude for allowing
such dams to break while the work in the distributary is
in progress or before it is measured. Now and then the
dam is wilfully cut. The remedy is to make the dam of
proper strength&mdash;the top should be 8 feet wide and a foot
above the water,&mdash;and to have it watched day and night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page139">[139]</span></p>

<p>At a bend in a channel there is often a silt bank next
the convex bank, and a hollow near the concave bank.
The average bed level is probably very much the same
as in the straight reaches. Removal of the silt bank is
unnecessary, and if removed it quickly forms again.</p>

<p>Any length of channel in which the depth of silt to
be cleared is small, say &middot;50 foot in a large channel and
&middot;40 foot in a small one, should not be cleared, provided
its length is considerable (say 1,000 feet), and that it is
not close to (say within 3,000 or 2,000 feet from) the
head of the channel. Estimates should be prepared
accordingly, the shallow digging being struck out.
Clearing a small depth of silt merely gives contractors
a chance of cheating by scraping the bed.</p>

<p>If the watercourses at the tail of a distributary are
silted, the people should be pressed to clear them.
Otherwise there will be heading up of the water of the
distributary, and silt deposit may result.</p>

<p>When a channel is scoured, any regulator in it can be
kept partly closed so as to reduce the surface slope in
the reach upstream of the regulator and encourage the
deposit of silt. A table should, in such cases, be drawn
up giving the gauge readings to be maintained at the
tail of the reach corresponding to given readings at the
head.</p>

<p>Various methods of protecting banks are described in
<i>River and Canal Engineering</i>, Chapter VI. The growing
of plants on the inner slopes of channels whose sides
fall in, needs special attention. Some remarks on this
are given in <i>Punjab Rivers and Works</i>, Chapter II.,
Art. 3. A specification for bushing is given in
<a href="#Page178">Appendix E</a> of this volume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page140">[140]</span></p>

<p>A Subdivisional Officer generally receives a steady
stream of applications from members of the irrigating
community regarding&mdash;among other matters&mdash;outlets
or watercourses. Generally these applications are made
over to the zilladar to be reported on. In a large
number of cases the applicant states that the irrigation
of his land or &#8220;holding&#8221; is not satisfactory, or has
fallen off, and sometimes he asks that it may be transferred,
wholly or in part, to another watercourse which
he thinks will give a better supply. In all such cases,
and in some others, the first requirement is a statement
of the irrigation figures. The irrigation register gives
only the total for the watercourse. A printed form
should be prepared with spaces for showing the name of
the distributary, villages, watercourses, holdings and
applicants concerned, and the nature of the application.
Below this is a form, prepared somewhat as shown
<a href="#Tab7">below</a>. When this form is filled in, the state of affairs
can at once be seen and much trouble is saved. The
zilladar obtains the figures from the old field registers.
The amount of detail required as to the applicant&#8217;s
lands depends on the nature of his application. If it
deals with only part of his land the other parts should
also be shown. He may for instance be giving a disproportionate
share of water to one part. If a transfer
to another watercourse is asked for, the figures for that
watercourse are also required.</p>

<p>If an application refers to a whole watercourse, the
Subdivisional Officer can frequently, with the aid of an
irrigation register and a set of chak maps, both kept
up to date, dispose personally of the case. A good plan
is to settle cases when on tour near the place concerned,
the applicant and the zilladar being present as well as
any other persons concerned. A certain number of
cases have to come up again on the following tour, but
all are settled in less time than is occupied if the papers
go up and down between the Subdivisional Officer and
the zilladar, the &#8220;file&#8221; of papers in any particular
case being constantly swollen by reminders from the
<span class="nowrap">applicant.<a id="FNanchor39" href="#Footnote39"
class="fnanchor">[39]</a></span> Moreover, the applicants know that their
views are known to the Subdivisional Officer. If the
outlets on a channel need a general remodelling, such
applications as those under consideration receive attention
in connection with the scheme. Otherwise all the
applications concerning one distributary can be considered
together. If, however, a case is pressing, or the
steps to be taken obvious, it can be settled without
reference to any other case.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote39"><a href="#FNanchor39"><span class="label">[39]</span></a>
The plan of personal settlement is distasteful not only to the
subordinates, but to the <i>munshi</i> who has charge of the &#8220;vernacular
files.&#8221; Ordinarily he can delay a case, or manipulate it to some
extent.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The general arrangements for the &#8220;revenue&#8221; work<span class="pagenum" id="Page142">[142]</span>
or assessment of water rates have been stated in Art. 1.
In the Punjab the remissions for failed crops are a
source of trouble. In some districts the failed areas are
small, and no particular trouble arises, but in other
districts such areas are often very large. On perennial
canals the crop inspection is done by the zilladars, on
most of the inundation canals by the subordinates of
the District <span class="nowrap">Magistrate.<a id="FNanchor40"
href="#Footnote40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></span> In both cases the amount
of labour involved is enormous, and the corruption to
which the system gives rise is also enormous. In the
case of the inundation canals the superior staff of the
District Magistrate nominally make checks, but the
time at their disposal is wholly inadequate. In the case
of the perennial canals the Canal Engineers are able to
exercise considerable checks, but nothing like enough.
In fact the state of a crop and the proportion of the
charge on it which should be remitted is a difficult thing
to judge, even if the subordinates were without guile.
It is understood that a new and statesmanlike system
is now to be introduced, the District Magistrate deciding,
in consultation with the Executive Engineer, whether
the season is such as to call for any general remission
for each kind of crop, and, if so, to what extent. The
proportion to be remitted in that crop is then to be fixed,
and it is to be the same for every one.</p>

<p>It has been mentioned that some irrigation is
effected by lift. The simplest form of lift is a horizontal
pole which rests, not far from its thick end, on a support.
From its thick end is suspended a bucket, and from its
thin end a weight. A man lifts the thin end so that the
bucket then dips into the water and is filled. Pulling<span class="pagenum" id="Page143">[143]</span>
down the thin end he raises the bucket and empties it.
A greatly improved lifting apparatus is the Persian
wheel which is vertical and has slung from it, like the
buckets of a dredger but moving vertically, a number of
earthen jars, which scoop up the water. As each jar
passes over the top of the wheel it assumes a horizontal
position, discharges its water into a shoot, and descends
in an inverted position. The wheel is moved by a simple
cog-wheel arrangement actuated by a bullock which is
driven round and round in a circular track. The
Persian wheel is used for lifts of any height. The lift
from a canal watercourse is a few feet, that from a well
may be 50 feet or more.</p>

<p>Most persons consider that a system of charging for
water by volume would be a very great advance on
present methods. It has been said that if the water
were wasted it would be difficult for the cultivators to
bring home the responsibility to any individual. This
objection does not seem to have great force. Every
individual would have a direct interest in economising
the water, and any cultivator who was habitually
careless would soon be detected by the others. In all
probability the result would be a great improvement in
the duty of the water. But the justice of any very
rigid system of charging by volume is somewhat
doubtful. The great difference in the duty of water on
different watercourses has been mentioned more than once.
Many of the causes of this are beyond the control of the
farmers, and it would probably be necessary to charge
reduced rates to some of them.</p>

<p class="inlineh"><a href="#Fig26">Fig. 26</a> shows part of the
Punjab. The areas marked L.J., L.C., U.B.D., and
S.C. are already irrigated by the Lower Jhelum, Lower
Chenab, Upper Bari <span class="nowrap">Doab<a id="FNanchor42" href="#Footnote42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></span> and Sirhind Canals. The
areas which it is considered very desirable to irrigate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page145">[145]</span>
and which are provided for in the Triple Canal Project,
are marked U.J., U.C., and L.B.D., and the new canals
are shown by dotted lines. Other areas needing
irrigation lie on the left bank of the lower part of the
Sutlej, partly in British territory and partly in
Bahawalpur State, and one <span class="nowrap">area,<a id="FNanchor43"
href="#Footnote43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></span> of scant rainfall and
subject to occasional famine, lies immediately South of
the Sirhind Canal tract. There is also a very large area
between the Indus and the Jhelum, and it has been
proposed to irrigate it from the Indus, but on account of
the presence of sand-hills the project is not likely to be
so useful as others, and it is held in abeyance. Perhaps
a small canal may be constructed, as a tentative
measure, to irrigate part of the tract.</p>

Doab means &#8220;two waters,&#8221; or the tract between two rivers. The

of the rivers. They are called the Jech (Jhelum-Chenab), Rechna
(Ravi-Chenab), and Bari (Beas-Ravi) Doabs.</p>

<p>In summer all the rivers have discharges (available
for the kharif crop) far exceeding any requirements. It
was at one time proposed to supply the Lower Bari
Doab Canal from near the junction of the Beas and
Sutlej, and a project for this was prepared, but before it
was sanctioned a proposal was put forward to convey<span class="pagenum" id="Page146">[146]</span>
the surplus water of the Jhelum eastward across the
Chenab and Ravi. This valuable suggestion was made
by Sir James Wilson, who was then Settlement Commissioner
of the Punjab, and, independently, by the late
Colonel S. L. Jacob, R.E., who had been a Chief
Engineer in the Punjab. The proposals were, however,
to take off the supply from the Jhelum lower down than
as now arranged in the Triple Project. This would have
resulted in only a partial utilisation of the Jhelum
water, in mutilation or heavy alterations to the existing
Lower Jhelum and Lower Chenab Canals, in for ever
debarring the Upper Jhelum and Upper Chenab tracts
from irrigation, and in a very costly scheme for the
Lower Bari Doab <span class="nowrap">Canal.<a id="FNanchor44" href="#Footnote44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote44"><a href="#FNanchor44"><span class="label">[44]</span></a>
Colonel Jacob made his suggestion when in England after retiring
from India, and when he had no levels to guide him.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The Triple Project as prepared by Sir John Benton,
K.C.I.E., recently Inspector General of Irrigation in
India, gets over all the above objections. The Upper
Jhelum Canal is to irrigate the country which it
traverses, and in the winter, when the supply in the
rivers is restricted, it is to deliver into the river Chenab,
above the weir at the head of the Lower Chenab Canal,
a discharge equal to that drawn out higher up by the
Upper Chenab <span class="nowrap">Canal.<a id="FNanchor45" href="#Footnote45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></span> Thus the Lower Chenab Canal,
which at present draws off the whole of the water of the
Chenab in winter, will not be injuriously affected in any
way. The Upper Chenab Canal after irrigating its own
tract is to deliver a large volume of water into the Ravi.
The water will be taken across that river by a level<span class="pagenum" id="Page147">[147]</span>
crossing, and supply the Lower Bari Doab Canal. The
water brought into the Sutlej from the Beas will remain
available for irrigation on the left bank of the Sutlej, or
possibly for the dry tract South of the Sirhind Canal
area. This fine scheme presented many difficulties and
is necessarily costly. The water has to be conveyed a
great distance, and there will be much loss by
absorption. The Ravi crossing will be a very heavy
work. The Upper Jhelum Canal has to be taken by a
circuitous course round a range of hills, and to cross
numerous heavy torrents. The scheme will, however,
prove remunerative in spite of immense difficulties as to
labour, caused by the outbreak of plague in the Punjab
a few years ago.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote45"><a href="#FNanchor45"><span class="label">[45]</span></a>
The Indus is at a higher level than the Jhelum. The latter river
runs in a comparatively deep valley, and it is unfortunately impossible
to convey the water of the Indus across this valley.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref3">2. <b>Areas and Discharges.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&nbsp;The figures on which
the discharges in the Triple Project are based form a
useful and interesting object lesson. In order to obtain
sufficient water in the winter, it is necessary to reduce
the rabi supply to the existing Lower Jhelum Canal.
The figure above given for the Jhelum indicates the
supply available after the reduction. More water will
be supplied to the Lower Jhelum Canal for the kharif,
the canal being enlarged for this purpose, and its total
irrigation will be unaffected. The proportion of the
culturable commanded area to be irrigated in the new
tracts is 75 per cent., but from this the area irrigated by
wells in the Upper Jhelum and Upper Chenab tracts is
deducted. On the Lower Bari Doab Canal there is
little well Irrigation, but there are some low-lying tracts
near the rivers, and of these only 50 per cent. will be
irrigated. The kharif and rabi areas are in all cases to
be equal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page148">[148]</span></p>

found to be, on the Upper Bari Doab Canal 10 c. feet
per second, and on the Lower Chenab Canal 8 c. feet
per second, per million square feet of wetted area
respectively. The conditions of the latter canal most
resemble those on the new canals under consideration.
The losses calculated on the wetted areas of the
channels, as designed, at 8 c. feet per second per million

<p>But in dry years the canals will be worked in rotation
during the rabi, the Upper Chenab and Lower Bari
Doab Canals being worked together, and the Upper
Jhelum and Lower Jhelum together.</p>

<p>When the Lower Jhelum Canal is closed, in course of
rotation, the Upper Jhelum Canal will still be flowing,
and the loss in it, 664 c. feet per second, has to be added
to the figure (2,126) given above, thus bringing up the loss
to 2,790 c. feet per second.</p>

<p>In order to ascertain what the state of affairs will be
in the rabi, the statistics obtained on the Lower Chenab
Canal were examined. These show that the rabi duty
at the distributary heads on that canal is 206 acres. On
the Upper Bari Doab Canal the duty at the distributary
heads is 263 acres, but 11 per cent. of the area receives
only &#8220;first waterings.&#8221; The duty based on the
remaining area is 234 acres. But the above duties are
only attained by running higher supplies in October and
March than during the intervening four months of the
crop. The following remarks and figures are taken from
the Report on the Project <span class="nowrap">Estimates:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The statistics of working of distributaries of the
Chenab and Bari Doab Canals give the average discharges
shown in the following table for the three years
ending with 1903-04. The losses by absorption are
calculated on the wetted areas for the different rotational
periods. The average discharge less absorption is the
supply which reached the heads of the distributaries.</p>

<p>&#8220;The above table goes to show the following:</p>

<p class="hind23">(<i>i</i>) In order to utilize the large supplies available
in the Jhelum River in October and March
every year and in some or all of the intervening

with those obtaining on the Lower
Chenab and Upper Bari Doab Canals.</p>

<p class="hind23">(<i>iii</i>) In dry years, that is, 1 in 4, it will be necessary
to attain a duty almost exactly the same as
that now obtaining on the Upper Bari Doab

<p class="hind23">(<i>iv</i>) That an exceptionally dry year might occur
once in 14 years, when the supply would be 10
per cent. short of that required by the average<span class="pagenum" id="Page156">[156]</span>

such exceptional cases should be met
by remissions, which will be far preferable to
wasting the good supplies of 13 years out of 14.</p>

<h3 class="inline">3. <b>Remarks.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&nbsp;The Report on the Project estimates
gives, for each tract, remarks on its soil, rainfall, height
of subsoil water, circumstances as to existing irrigation
from wells or small canals and liability to floods. On
a consideration of these matters the decision as to the
particular parts of the tracts which are to be irrigated
and the areas which are, in the rabi, to receive only
restricted irrigation, <span class="nowrap">depends.<a id="FNanchor50" href="#Footnote50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote50"><a href="#FNanchor50"><span class="label">[50]</span></a>
It is not unusual, in tracts where the level of the subsoil water is
high, say within 15 feet of the surface, to have some &#8220;kharif distributaries.&#8221;
These are closed in the rabi. This tends to prevent water-logging
of the soil. In the rabi the people lift water from wells.
There may also be kharif distributaries in dry tracts if there is no
water to spare in the rabi.</p>

<p>In calculating the sizes of the canals, N in Kutter&#8217;s
co-efficient was taken at &middot;020. In sharp curves the bed
is paved on the side next the concave bank. In high
embankments where the soil is sandy the best material
is used as a core wall. The torrent works on the
Upper Jhelum Canal have been mentioned in <i>River and
Canal Engineering</i>, Chapter XII.</p>

<p>Regarding the effect of the new canals on the
inundation canals which take off, lower down, from the
Chenab below its confluence with the Jhelum, it has for
long been the policy to gradually shift the heads of these
canals upstream in order to obtain better supplies, or
rather to counteract the effect of the abstraction of<span class="pagenum" id="Page157">[157]</span>
water for the recently constructed Lower Chenab and
Lower Jhelum Canals. Any such abstraction of
water has not much effect on the floods, but it has
much effect in April and May, when the rivers have not
fully risen, and in September, when they are falling.</p>

<p>In order to estimate the effect on the water level of
the Chenab&mdash;below its junction with the Jhelum&mdash;it
was necessary to observe discharges of the river, not
only in the winter when it is low, but in the summer
when it is high. The depth of the water was in some
places 40 feet, and the stream 2,000 feet wide. Fortunately
the Subdivisional Officer was a native of India and
did not much mind the sun. A discharge curve (<i>River
and Canal Engineering</i>, Chapter III. Art. 5,) having been
prepared, it was possible to construct a diagram with
periods of time as the abscissas, the ordinates representing
the average known gauge readings on the different dates
and another set of ordinates representing the probable
discharges. By deducting the discharges which it was
intended that the new perennial canals should draw off,
it was possible to draw fresh ordinates representing the
diminished river discharges and the reduced river gauge
readings corresponding to them. It was found that the
water level would be lowered by about 1&middot;3 feet in April
and May, and by about 1&middot;5 feet in September. It
was, however, shown that by shifting the heads of the
inundation canals upstream&mdash;the gradients of the
canals being flatter than that of the river&mdash;the effect of
the lowering of the water level could, as heretofore, be
nullified.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="chapname"><span class="smcap">Proposed Improvements in Irrigation Canals.</span></span></h2>

<h3 class="inline">1. <b>Preliminary Remarks.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&mdash;The chief improvements
which have been under consideration during recent
years are three in number. The first is increased
economy of water in its actual use in the fields; the
second is reduction of the losses by absorption in the
channels; and the third is distribution by means of
modules.</p>

<p>Regarding the first, it has long been known that the
ordinary methods of laying on the water are more or
less wasteful. In California, when the water instead of
being applied to the surface of the ground, is brought in
a pipe and delivered below the ground level, the duty is
increased from 250 to 500 acres. In India a field is
divided, by means of small ridges of earth, into large
compartments. The water is let into a compartment
and gradually covers it. By the time the further side
is soaked the nearer side has received far too much
water. Frequently the water for a compartment,
instead of being carried up to it by a small watercourse,
is passed through another compartment and this adds
to the waste. Also the number of waterings given to a
crop is often 5 or 6, when 4 would suffice. Experiments
made on the Upper Bari Doab Canal, by Kennedy,
showed that the water used in the fields was nearly
double what it might have been. The 53 c. ft. shown
in <a href="#Ref18">Chapter 1, Art. 4</a>, as reaching the fields, were used
up when 28 c. ft. would have sufficed. It is not certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page159">[159]</span>
that the waste is generally quite as much as the above.
It is possible that the restricted supplies might have
given smaller yields of crops. More recent experiments
made by Kanthack on the same canal give the needless
waste as about 25 per cent. The field compartments
ought, according to Kennedy, to be 70ft. square, the
small branch watercourses being 140ft. apart. It would
be better to have still smaller compartments, but this
would be rather hard on the people.</p>

<p>At one time Government issued orders, in Northern
India, that compartments of 1296 square feet were to be
used, and that, otherwise, increased water rates would
be charged, but the orders were never enforced. They
were thought to press too hardly on the people.
Extreme measures for enforcing economy in the use of
water in any country are likely to be introduced only
when they become absolutely necessary owing to the
supplies of water being otherwise insufficient.</p>

<h3 class="inline">2. <b>Reduction of Losses in the Channels.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&mdash;For
several years experiments have been going on in the
Punjab as to the effect of lining watercourses with
various materials. The following conclusions have been
arrived <span class="nowrap">at<a id="FNanchor51" href="#Footnote51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote51"><a href="#FNanchor51"><span class="label">[51]</span></a>
<i>Punjab Irrigation Paper</i> No. 11 C. &#8220;Lining of Watercourses
to reduce absorption losses. Experiments of 1908-1911.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<h4>I. <span class="smcap">Ordinary Unlined Trenches.</span></h4>

<p class="hind48">(<i>a</i>) The rate of absorption varies greatly, and this
is due probably to unequal fissuring of the
upper layers of the soil.</p>

<p class="hind48">(<i>b</i>) The rate of absorption in the three hottest
months averaged &middot;0571 feet per hour, or more
than double the rate (&middot;026) in the three coldest<span class="pagenum" id="Page160">[160]</span>
months. The difference is ascribed to the
greater viscosity of the water when cold.</p>

<p class="hind48">(<i>c</i>) The average losses with canal water were &middot;0315
feet per hour, or 8&middot;75 c. feet per second per
million sq. <span class="nowrap">feet.<a id="FNanchor52" href="#Footnote52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></span> With well water the figures
were &middot;1096 and 30&middot;5. The conclusion is that
the silt in canal water reduces the losses by
more than two-thirds.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote52"><a href="#FNanchor52"><span class="label">[52]</span></a>
This loss of 8&middot;75 c. ft. per second was in water only about a foot
deep. This confirms the conclusion arrived at in <a href="#Ref18">Chapter I, Art. 4</a>,
that the depth of water is not a factor of much importance.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p class="hind48">(<i>d</i>) With canal water the average loss decreased by
40 per cent. (from &middot;0491 to &middot;0293) in about
four years. This was no doubt due to the
effect of the silt. With well water the loss at
the end of four years (&middot;2293) was nearly four
times as great as at first (&middot;0591). This may
have been due to removal of the finer particles
of soil by the water, but the experiments were
made at only one place, and were not conclusive.</p>

<h4>II. <span class="smcap">Lined Trenches.</span></h4>

<p class="hind48">(<i>e</i>) With trenches lined with crude oil &sup1;&#8260;&#8321;&#8326; inch
thick, or with Portland cement &sup1;&#8260;&#8321;&#8326; inch thick,
or with clay puddle 6 inches thick, the
&#8220;efficiency ratios,&#8221; as compared with unlined
trenches, are respectively about 4&middot;0, 5&middot;7 and
5&middot;7, the age of the lining being four years.
The efficiency ratio is the inverse of the loss.
Thus with an efficiency ratio of 3 the loss in
the lined trench is 33 per cent. of that in the
unlined trench.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page161">[161]</span></p>

<p class="hind48">(<i>f</i>) The efficiency ratio in the case of oil may
diminish at the rate of 10 per cent. per annum,
but in the case of cement and clay puddle it
tends to increase rather than to decrease.</p>

<p class="blankbefore1">Assuming that the efficiency ratios are only 3&middot;0, 4&middot;5
and 4&middot;5, and that the loss in an unlined channel is
8 c. feet per second per million sq. feet, the saving in
water by using channels lined with oil, cement and
puddle respectively would be 5&middot;33, 6&middot;25 and 6&middot;25 c. feet
per second. The average duty of the water at the canal
head is about 242 acres, and the average revenue per
acre is Rs 3&middot;93. The revenue from 1 c. ft. of water at
the canal head is thus Rs 950. Only about half the
water reaches the fields (<a href="#Ref18">Chapter I., Art. 4</a>), and the
revenue from 1 c. ft. of water which reaches the fields
is about Rs 1900. The mean of the above two sums is
Rs 1425. If 6 c. ft. of water per second could be saved
the revenue would be increased by Rs 8,550 per annum.</p>

<p>The cost of lining a million square feet of channel
with oil, cement and puddle is estimated at Rs 30,000,
Rs 27,500 and Rs 35,000 respectively. Allowance has
to be made for the fact that watercourses flow intermittently,
and that a lined channel gives no saving
when it is not in flow, also that extensions of canals
might have to be undertaken in order to utilise the
water saved. After making these allowances it is
estimated, in the paper above quoted, that the saving
effected by lining a million square feet with oil, cement
or puddle represents the interest on a capital sum of
Rs 69,300, Rs 81,250 and Rs 81,250 respectively, or 2
or 3 times the sums sunk in constructing the linings.</p>

<p>Hitherto the experiments have been carried out on a
moderate scale, but extensive operations are now being<span class="pagenum" id="Page162">[162]</span>
undertaken on the Lower Chenab Canal, and possibly on
others.</p>

<p>In cases where it is not desired to incur much expenditure,
it may be a good plan to construct watercourses
to a cross section somewhat larger than that ultimately
desired. The silt deposited on the bed and sides forms,
in most cases, a more impervious lining than the original
soil. The same plan can be adopted in the tail portion
of a distributary. In a larger channel there would be less
certainty that any deposit would take place unless short
lengths, at frequent intervals, were excavated to the
true or ultimate section, so as to form weirs and spurs;
and even these might not stand.</p>

<p>In Italy, in cases where the water naturally contains
lime in suspension, the beds of canals have become
gradually watertight by the deposit of lime in the
<span class="nowrap">channel.<a id="FNanchor53" href="#Footnote53"
class="fnanchor">[53]</a></span> In some cases lime has been artificially
added. It appears that a considerable period of time is
necessary for the process.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref17">3. <b>Modules.</b></h3>

<p class="inlineh">&mdash;A module is an appliance which automatically
gives a constant discharge through an aperture,
however the water level on either the upstream or
downstream side of the aperture may fluctuate. In an
old and simple form of module there is a horizontal
orifice in which works loosely a tapering rod attached
to a float. The water passes through the annular space
surrounding the rod. If the water level rises, the rise
of the float brings a thicker part of the rod to the
orifice and reduces the annular space. In another kind
of module the water is discharged through a syphon.
If the water level alters, the syphon moves in such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page163">[163]</span>
way that the head, or difference between the levels of
its two ends, remains the same. The great objections
to modules are that they are liable to get out of order
or to be tampered with. A module recently invented
and patented by <span class="nowrap">Gibb<a id="FNanchor54" href="#Footnote54"
class="fnanchor">[54]</a></span> has no movable parts, and is
not liable to these objections.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote54"><a href="#FNanchor54"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> For description see <a href="#Page186">Appendix H</a>.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>A few years ago the question of the desirability of
using modules for the outlets of distributaries in India
was raised. The opinions of a large number of the
senior canal engineers were called for and considered,
and since then the subject has been thoroughly discussed.
There are certain inherent difficulties in the
way of moduling the outlets of a distributary. Owing,
for instance, to rain further up the canal, or to the
closure of a distributary owing to a breach in it, the
canal supply may increase, and it may be necessary to
let more water into the distributary under consideration.
Under the present system any excesses of water
are automatically taken by the outlets. If all outlets
were rigidly moduled they would discharge no more
than before the excess supply came in, and the excess
supply would all go to the tail of the distributary, and,
most likely, breach the banks. To get over this
difficulty, the module has to be so arranged that when
the water level in the distributary rises to a certain
&#8220;maximum limit&#8221; the module ceases to act as such,
and the discharge drawn off from the distributary
increases as the water level rises. Again, the discharge
of the distributary may at times be considerably less
than its full supply. In order that, in such a case, the
outlets towards the tail of the distributary may not be
wholly deprived of water, it has to be arranged so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page164">[164]</span>
when the water level in the distributary falls below a
certain &#8220;minimum limit&#8221; the modules cease to act as
such, and draw off supplies which are less the lower the
water level. Such supplies are not in proportion to the
full supplies of the outlets. It will, however, be shown
presently that low supplies need seldom be run.
When a distributary, say the upper reach, contains silt,
the water level corresponding to a given discharge is
higher than before, and care has to be taken that the
maximum limit is high enough. At the same time the
minimum limit must be so low that it will not be passed
when the silt scours out. The difference between the
maximum and minimum limits is called the &#8220;range&#8221;
of the module.</p>

<p>In Gibb&#8217;s module the above conditions can be complied
with. The module is placed outside the bank of
the distributary. The water is drawn off from the
distributary by a pipe, whose lower edge is at the bed
level of the distributary, and delivered from the module
into the watercourse through a rectangular aperture at
a higher level than that of the pipe. It is possible
that, owing to the high level of the aperture, some
rolling silt which would otherwise have passed out
of the distributary may remain in it. The height of
the aperture also prevents the watercourse from drawing
off any water at all when the water level of the distributary
falls below a certain level, but this objection is
not important. An escape weir or notch is provided
so that when the water level in the distributary rises
to the maximum limit some water overflows into the
watercourse. On the whole it appears that all difficulties
can be got over, though a good deal of care and<span class="pagenum" id="Page165">[165]</span>
precision is necessary in fixing the exact height of the
maximum and minimum limits.</p>

<p>The difficulties under consideration will all be reduced
if some of the outlets on a distributary are left unmoduled,
and this is desirable on other grounds.
When the supply is normal, <i>i.e.</i> between the maximum
and minimum limits, and all modules are working, the
supply entering the distributary must be regulated with
great precision. The outlets draw off a certain supply.
If less than this enters the distributary the tail outlets
must go short. If more enters there will be a surplus
at the tail, though it can probably be disposed of,
because the tail water will rise above the maximum
limit. For short periods, say an hour or two, no trouble
arises because the distributary acts as a reservoir, the
water level rising to take in any excess supply, and
falling to allow for a deficiency. At the tail the rise
and fall may be hardly perceptible. But if the supply
were deficient for a whole night the tail outlets would
certainly go short. This could theoretically be remedied
to some extent by letting in an excess supply for a short
time and causing the water level at the tail to rise above
the maximum limit, but in practice no such system of
compensation could be worked. The very fact of the
tail outlets having gone short for a night would not be
known. The proper method of preventing any such
troubles as those under consideration is to leave some of
the outlets on the distributary un-moduled.</p>

<p>It has been more than once mentioned that there are
periods when a distributary is run, not full, but about
three-fourths full. If that were done in the case of a
distributary whose outlets were mostly moduled, the
water level would probably be below the minimum limit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page166">[166]</span>
and the modules would not be acting as such. The
outlets would not, under these circumstances, obtain
their proper proportionate supplies. This difficulty can,
no doubt, be got over by running the distributary full
for short periods at a time instead of three-fourths full
for longer periods. The people, when once they understood
the case, could arrange to use the water in greater
volume for two days instead of in smaller volume for
three. If this arrangement comes into force it will not
be necessary to design distributaries&mdash;see <a href="#Ref19">Chapter III,
Art. 4</a>&mdash;so as to have a good command when three-fourths
full supply is run.</p>

<p>On nearly every distributary there are some watercourses
whose command is bad, and it has been stated
(<a href="#Ref4">Chapter II, Art. 9</a>) that in an ordinary unmoduled distributary
the sizes of the outlets in such cases should
be extremely liberal. To module any such outlet would
cause a lowering of the water level in the watercourse
and would interfere with the irrigation. Such outlets
should not be moduled. Again, there are some few
outlets which are not submerged, <i>i.e.</i>, there is a free fall
into the watercourse. The discharge does not depend
on the water level in the watercourse, and it is not
affected by any enlargement or clearance of it. It
depends only on the water level in the distributary.
This water level, if most of the outlets are moduled,
will be fairly constant. Such outlets need not be
moduled, and they should not be moduled unless the
other unmoduled outlets in the reach concerned are
sufficiently numerous, and perhaps not even then,
because moduling involves some expense.</p>

<p>A distributary generally has some falls which divide
it into reaches. Immediately upstream of a fall the<span class="pagenum" id="Page167">[167]</span>
water level for a given discharge is not affected by the
silting or scouring of the channel. Any outlets near to
and upstream of the fall are less subject than others to
variation in discharge, and are suitable for non-moduling
in case a sufficient number of unmoduled outlets is not
otherwise obtainable.</p>

<p>Regarding the watercourses at the extreme tail of a
distributary it has been pointed out (<a href="#Ref20">Chapter III.,
Art. 7</a>) that in an ordinary case they should not be left
without masonry outlets, because they may then lower
the water level and so unfairly reduce the supply of any
watercourse, even though upstream of them, which has
such an outlet. But any outlets near the tail of a
distributary can suitably be left unmoduled because of
the difficulty of ensuring that the supply at the tail
shall be exactly what is needed.</p>

<p>Gibb&#8217;s modules have been tried on various distributaries
in the Punjab and found to give good results. It
is believed however that in only one case has a whole
distributary been moduled. The distributary is a large
one, its length being 35 miles. It appears that the
discharge reaching the tail of the distributary is not
constant but varies, as was to be expected, when the
head discharge varies for any length of time. The
command on the distributary is good. There is nothing
to show that matters would not have been improved,
and money saved, by leaving some of the outlets without
modules.</p>

<p>It has been remarked above, that at the downstream
end of a reach ending in a fall, the F.S. level of a
distributary is not affected by silt. At the upstream
end of the reach it is affected. There are thus two<span class="pagenum" id="Page168">[168]</span>
gradients, one flat, and one steep. It appears to have
been decided in one case in the Punjab, that the
minimum limit of supply for the module should be about
half an inch below the flat line and the maximum limit
&middot;3 feet above the steep line. In many cases a greater
range would be <span class="nowrap">required,<a id="FNanchor55" href="#Footnote55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></span> say a foot.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote55"><a href="#FNanchor55"><span class="label">[55]</span></a>
It is understood that a range of a foot can easily be arranged for,
and that ranges of 3 or 4 feet can be introduced at slightly increased cost.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>In <a href="#Ref20">Chapter III. Art. 7</a>, the case of a distributary
without modules but with the outlets carefully adjusted,
was considered. The question to be decided in each
case is whether such an arrangement is preferable to
moduling some of the outlets. This turns largely on
the amount of attention which would be bestowed on
the case. In view of the difficulty of securing such
attention and of the trouble of constantly making alterations
in a certain number of outlets, it is probable that
moduling will in many cases be considered preferable.</p>

<p>The question of moduling the heads of distributaries
has also been considered in the Punjab. For minor or
small distributaries modules are feasible. For a large
distributary a module would be expensive and it appears
that the present system of regulating is preferable.</p>

<p>Kennedy&#8217;s &#8220;Gauge Outlet,&#8221; which is a kind of semi-module
is described in <a href="#Page193">Appendix K</a>. It is being tried
in the Punjab.</p>

<span class="chapname">DIVIDE WALL ON LOWER CHENAB CANAL.</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The Gagera branch of the Lower Chenab Canal&mdash;the left-hand
branch in <a href="#Fig27">fig. 27</a>&mdash;was found to silt. It was proposed
to make a divide wall (<a href="#Fig27">fig. 27</a>) extending up to
full supply level. The idea is unintelligible. The silt
does not travel by itself but is carried or rolled by the
water. As long as water entered the Gagera branch, silt
would go with it. The authorities, who had apparently
accepted the proposal, altered the estimate when they
received it, and ordered the wall to be made as shown
dotted and of only half the height. This was done. The
idea seems to have been that the wall would act as a sill<span class="pagenum" id="Page170">[170]</span>
and stop rolling silt. This is intelligible, but such sills
do not always have much effect on rolling silt. Moreover,
there was a large gap, A B, in the wall. The work is said
to have proved useless, and proposals have been made to
continue the wall from A to B. In this form it is conceivable
that it may be of use.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX E.<br />
<span class="chapname">SPECIFICATION FOR BUSHING.</span></h3>

<p class="appref">(See <a href="#Page139">page 139</a>.)</p>

<p>1. The object of bushing is to form a silt berm and thus
prevent or stop the falling in of the banks.</p>

<p>2. The branches must be thickly packed in order that
the water among them may become still, and also in order
that they may not be shifted by the stream. If thickly
packed, the pegs required will also be fewer. Most of the
branches should be leafy and freshly cut, but, mixed with
these, there may be a proportion of kikar or other leafless
branches. Frequently it is possible to utilise jungle trees
of small value, bushes, scrub jungle, or even long grass.</p>

<p>3. Except when the bushes are to be very small or the
length to be bushed very short, the proposed line for the
edge of the berm should be marked out by long stakes
driven in the water at fairly close intervals. Otherwise
the work may be badly done and the berm formed
imperfect and out of line.</p>

<p>4. As the berm formed is not likely in any case to be
perfectly straight, and as subsequent additions to it will
be difficult, while trimming it will be easy, the bushes
should extend slightly beyond the line of the proposed
berm. Care should be taken that the lower branches,
which cannot be seen when once submerged, are long
enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page179">[179]</span></p>

<p>5. The branches should be piled up to above water-level,
so that, as they settle, they will assume the position
desired, but to lay them high above full-supply level on
the slopes is useless and wasteful. If the pegs have to be
driven at a high level, the branches should be attached to
them by thin ropes or twine. Long pegs standing up
high above the ground are also wasteful. The pegs should
as far as possible be kept in line and their heads at
one level.</p>

<p>6. If bushing is begun during low supply, it need not,
at first, extend up to full-supply level. More branches,
freshly cut, can be added as the supply rises. In any case
it is generally necessary to make some additions to bushing
from time to time, and this should be explained to contractors
and others when fixing the rates.</p>

<p>7. If the trees from which branches are cut are in
desirable places, the branches should be cut with judgment;
but where trees are in places where they should not be
(<i>e.g.</i>, on the inside slopes of the channels), all the branches
may be cut off. The trunk may be left temporarily in
order to supply more branches.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page180">[180]</span></p>

<h3>APPENDIX F.<br />
<span class="chapname">ESCAPES.</span></h3>

<p class="appref">(See <a href="#Page9">page 9</a>.)</p>

<p>There are no definite rules regarding the capacity of the
escapes to be provided on a canal. On some canals in dry
tracts of country the discharging power of the escapes is a
mere fraction of that of the canal. In other cases it is
about half that of the canal. In a district liable to heavy
rain an escape, say at a point where a canal divides into
branches, should be able to discharge about half of the
main canal supply. On branches, escapes, if provided at all,
usually discharge into reservoirs, and their period of working
is very limited: it may be only twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>On distributaries, escapes are seldom provided. It has
been suggested, in connection with modules, that the
people irrigating from each watercourse should be responsible
for disposing, by means of it, of a certain
quantity of surplus water. This would be too rigid a rule.
On some watercourses there is much waste land or land
under rice cultivation; in such cases surplus water can be
passed off without damage. The canal subordinates are
fully cognisant of such cases, and they arrange accordingly.
In other cases surplus water would do some damage; but on
nearly every distributary the full supply, even when there
is no demand for water, can be got rid of for a few hours,
or even more, without a breach occurring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page181">[181]</span></p>

<p>Escapes at outlets, in connection with modules, can be
arranged by means of waste weirs or by means of Gregotti&#8217;s
syphons (<i>sifoni autolivelatori</i>). The following is an
abridged translation of part of a pamphlet by <span class="nowrap">Gregotti:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="gregotti blankbefore1">The <a href="#Fig28">figure</a> represents one of the syphons installed in the &#8220;Centrali
Milani.&#8221;</p>

<p class="gregotti">A is the supply basin of the &#8220;Centrali,&#8221; which ends in the syphon B.
The latter is constructed with mouthpiece of rectangular section <i>a</i>, which
is submerged in the basin A. A weir divides the mouthpiece of the
syphon from the descending branch, <i>c</i>, of the same, also rectangular in
section. The weir crest is at level <i>dd</i>, from 2 to 7 cm. below the
maximum level of water surface which it is desired not to exceed in the
supply basin.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig28">
<img src="images/illo201.png" alt="Gregotti siphon" width="450" height="394" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 28.</p>
</div>

<p class="gregotti">The descending branch, <i>c</i>, has at its base a small tank <i>e</i>, which forms a
water seal. The syphon is completed by a tube <i>f</i>, which is attached to
the intake branch of the syphon and which ends at a level of 2 to 7 cm.
above the previously mentioned surface <i>dd</i>.</p>

<p class="gregotti">As soon as the water surface in the supply basin tends to rise above
the plane <i>dd</i>, a filament of water, in falling over the weir <i>b</i>, pours
down the descending branch <i>c</i>, and when the water has risen from
2 to 7 cm. above the crest of the weir, the thickness of the falling stream
has become such that it is able, by lapping, with a wave-like course, the
wall <i>gg</i>, to extract the air that has become enclosed in the syphon, and
which cannot be replaced because the space in which the stream acts is
closed at its base by the water in the tank <i>e</i>; and at the top also the
aeration tube is closed by the rise in the water surface of the supply
basin. From this point the syphon action quickly becomes fully
established and begins to give its full discharge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page182">[182]</span></p>

<p class="gregotti">The discharge that is given is equal to that of an orifice in a thin
partition if certain limitations are allowed for between the fall used in
the syphon and the height of the arch, that is, the distance from the
crest of the weir to the inside roof of the syphon.</p>

gradually from the maximum discharge to zero as the water surface falls
a few centimetres till it reaches its original level.</p>

<p class="gregotti">In certain cases it is possible to do without the aeration tube,

<span class="chapname">GAUGES.</span></h3>

<p class="appref">(See <a href="#Ref23">Chap. III., Arts. 2</a> and <a href="#Ref12">3</a>; also see <i>Hydraulics</i>,
Chap. VIII., Art. 5, and <a href="#Page186">Appendix H</a>.)</p>

<p>1. The gauge should be placed on that bank and
facing in that direction which enables it to be most conveniently
read by the gauge reader and by officials passing
the place.</p>

<p>2. The gauge should be of enamelled iron secured by
copper screws to a post of squared and seasoned wood
which is either driven <span class="nowrap">beforehand<a id="FNanchor64"
href="#Footnote64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></span> into the channel or
spiked to a masonry work. Even in the deepest channel
a long enough post can be arranged for. A masonry
pillar is not necessary. The post may be rectangular in
cross-section, with upstream and downstream edges cut
sharp. This prevents, or greatly reduces, the heaping up
of water at the upstream side and the formation of a
hollow downstream. If the &#8220;Ward&#8221; gauge of two
vertical planks is used, the planks should meet at an
acute angle, not a right angle, and not be wider than
7 inches each.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote64"><a href="#FNanchor64"><span class="label">[64]</span></a>
Driving after the gauge is attached may loosen or break the screws.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>3. The top of the gauge should be slightly above the
highest probable water-level. The post should extend up
to the top of the gauge.</p>

<p>4. If ever the graded bed of the channel is altered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page184">[184]</span>
zero of the gauge should be altered. There may be some
risk of confusion at first, but it can be avoided by exercising
due care and making notes. The levels of the old and
new zeros should be recorded.</p>

<p>5. A gauge at a distance from the bank is objectionable.
It collects jungle, cannot be properly read, and is liable to
be damaged by floating logs or boats. A gauge should be
as near as possible to one bank or the other. If the bank
is vertical, the gauge should be quite close to it. If, owing
to silt deposit, the gauge is dry at low supply, the deposit
can be removed by the gauge reader.</p>

<p>6. Every regulator should be given a name, generally
that of a neighbouring village and not that of a channel,
and the gauge book headings should be drawn up in an
intelligent and systematic manner. Each main channel
should be entered in order, and each regulator on the
channel&mdash;together with the head gauges of all channels
which take off there&mdash;should be entered, commencing from
upstream. A specimen is given on <a href="#Page109">page 109</a>. Thus the
head gauge of any branch appears in the register of the
main channel from which it takes off, other gauges on the
branch appearing in the register for the branch. And
similarly as regards a distributary which has gauges other
than the head gauge.</p>

<p>7. Each gauge reader should be supplied with a register,
each page having, besides the counterfoil, as many detachable
slips&mdash;marked off by perforations&mdash;as there are
officials&mdash;usually the Subdivisional Officer, zilladar and suboverseer&mdash;to
whom daily gauge reports are to be sent. The
titles and addresses of these officials are printed on the
backs of the respective slips. The slips and counterfoil
have printed on them a form&mdash;similar to part of the
specimen shown on <a href="#Page109">page 109</a>&mdash;showing the names of all
the gauges read by that particular gauge reader, so that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page185">[185]</span>
has merely to fill in the date and readings, tear off the slips
and despatch them. The posting of the register in the
subdivision is facilitated if each gauge has a number and
if the corresponding numbers are printed&mdash;besides the
names&mdash;on the gauge slips. If the gauge reader does not
know English, the headings of the slips are printed in the
vernacular. If the gauge readings are telegraphed, there
may be only one slip&mdash;besides the counterfoil&mdash;which is
sent to the telegraph signaller.</p>

embodied in what is probably the simplest piece of

<p>It is portable, and can be erected at any desired site
very simply and easily.</p>

<p>It is strong and durable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page187">[187]</span></p>

<p>The range of variation of both up- and downstream
water-levels through which the discharge remains
constant is more than sufficient to meet all the
requirements of irrigation canals.</p>

<p>The sufficiency of the delivery can be ascertained at
a glance.</p>

<p>The water can be drawn from any desired depth in
the parent channel.</p>

<p>When desired, means are provided whereby the
supply can be closed or opened at will.</p>

<p>Means are provided, if desired, for a sudden increase
of discharge when the upstream water-level
exceeds a certain limit, so that surplus water,
which might endanger the safety of the canal,
is allowed to escape into the branch whenever
the danger limit is reached. The upstream
water-level at which escapement begins can be
fixed in accordance with the requirements of
each site, and the action of the escape notch is
independent of the opening and closing of the
module.</p>

<p>No designing or calculations are required. These
have already been worked out. Known the
discharge required, the module is supplied complete
and ready for setting in position in the
canal bank.</p>

</div><!--gibb-->

<h4><span class="smcap">Hydraulic Principle.</span></h4>

<p>The entire absence of moving parts is the chief feature
of Gibb&#8217;s module; the water simply regulates itself by
using up all the excess of energy over and above that
required to discharge the correct supply of water.
The way in which this takes place will be understood
from the following <span class="nowrap">analogy:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page188">[188]</span></p>

<p>We all know that when we stir tea in a cup so as
to make it spin, the liquid rises at the rim of the cup
and curves down into a depression in the middle, and
the greater the spin the more marked this effect is. It
is, we know, the centrifugal force produced by the spin
that makes the tea remain high at the rim of the cup.
If, while the tea is thus spinning, a teaspoon is held so
that it dips slightly below the surface of the liquid
near the rim, it will obstruct the flow of the outer
portion of the liquid, which will fall in towards the
depression in the middle. The reason for this, of
course, is that the centrifugal force is absorbed when
we interrupt any part of the spin with the teaspoon;
hence the liquid must fall, and we know that when
liquid falls it uses up &#8220;head&#8221; or energy.</p>

<p>In Gibb&#8217;s module a similar action is made to take
place in a steel chamber, semicircular or spiral in
plan, through which the water flows in a semicircular
path instead of circulating round and round as in the
teacup. The surface of the stream, however, assumes
the same form as it does in a cup, because it flows
under the same conditions. Across the chamber are
fixed a number of vertical steel diaphragm plates which
take the place of the teaspoon in the above analogy.
The lower edges of these plates are of such a shape,
and they are fixed at such a height from the bottom
of the chamber, as to allow a stream of just the correct
required discharge of water to flow under them without
interference. But if, owing to an increase of head
caused by a rise in the upstream water-level, the water
tends to rise higher at the circumference of the chamber,
then the water at the surface of the stream strikes
against the diaphragm plates, and its centrifugal force
being absorbed, it will fall in towards the centre just as<span class="pagenum" id="Page189">[189]</span>
happened in the teacup when the spoon was used in
place of these plates. In this way the excess head
that caused the additional rise of water at the circumference
is used up by the fall back towards the centre.
The full capacity of the semicircle or spiral for using
up excess head or energy in this way is made available
by the use of a sufficient number of diaphragm plates
fixed at suitable intervals. When the range of head
to be dealt with is not large, then a semicircular
chamber is sufficient; but for large ranges of head the
chamber is made of spiral form so as to lead the water
round a complete revolution or more, as may be necessary.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Structural Details.</span></h4>

<p><a href="#Fig29">Fig. 29</a> shows the general form and structure of the
type of module suitable for irrigation. <a href="#Fig30">Fig. 30</a> is from
a photograph.</p>

<p>The working chamber or shell A is constructed of
mild steel plating securely riveted to a framework of
angle steel, and the semicircular form of the shell with
the rigid diaphragm plates B B riveted to the walls
makes a very strong structure, and ensures durability.</p>

<p>The &#8220;leading-in&#8221; bend C is of cast iron strongly
bolted to the steel shell, and is so designed as to
deliver the water into the module chamber in a completely
established vortex condition.</p>

<p>The socket D on this &#8220;leading-in&#8221; bend is made so
as to allow of considerable latitude in the vertical alignment
of the straight leading-in pipe, so that the water
can be drawn from any desired depth in the parent
channel, and the proportion of silt drawn off is thus
brought under control.</p>

off the flow through the module, are provided, if required,
but all modules are not fitted in this way, because many
irrigation authorities consider it undesirable to provide
the consumers with unrestricted facilities for closing
off their supplies without previously giving notice of
such an action.</p>

</div>

<p>An escape notch H is provided in the position indicated
when desired. It may, however, be found difficult
to determine beforehand the upstream water-level at<span class="pagenum" id="Page192">[192]</span>
which it is necessary to allow this escape of surplus
supply, so that it is generally more satisfactory to cut
the escape notch after the modules have been installed
and actual experience has indicated a suitable level for
the notch crest.</p>

<p>In the standard type of module for irrigation purposes
the top of the module chamber is completely open, as
shown, and this is the type generally recommended, as
it is found that consumers have greater confidence in
an apparatus which hides nothing from them. To meet
the needs of special cases, however, a second type is
also made in which the chamber is completely closed
and considerably reduced in height, being thus specially
suitable for sites where space is confined.</p>

<p>Pipes I, of diameter suitable for all sizes of modules,
are also supplied. These may either be welded steel or
cast iron, as desired. An 18-feet length of pipe is usually
found sufficient to bring the supply through the canal
bank to the module.</p>

<p>All modules supplied are treated with anti-corrosive
paint, which ensures the protection of the metal.</p>

<span class="horsplit"><span class="top">V&sup2; - <i>v</i>&sup2;</span><span class="bot">2<i>g</i></span></span>.</p>

<p>This quantity (since <i>v</i> is small) is not much less than <i>h</i>&#8320;
or <span class="horsplit"><span class="top">V&sup2;</span><span class="bot">2<i>g</i></span></span>.
In other words, the water levels of two cisterns
with an air-space between them differ only a little, or <i>h</i>&#8321;
is small.</p>

<p>The above case (two cisterns and air-space) is mentioned
in <i>Hydraulics</i>, Chap. V. The principle is simply that
the velocity head at the air-space is reconverted into
pressure head by passing the stream through a gradually
diverging tube. In the absence of such a tube the
velocity head would be wasted by causing eddies in
the downstream cistern.</p>

<p>If the downstream cistern is a watercourse whose
water-level is considerably lower than that of the upstream
cistern or distributary, V is obviously unaffected.
Also P&#8321; is obviously reduced. Therefore, by Bernouilli,
<i>v</i> is increased, or the stream does not fill the expanded
tube and there are eddies in the tube. The water-level
in the watercourse may even be lower than the end
of the tube. The discharge is unaffected.</p>

<p>In practice there are, of course, resistances, but this
fact does not affect the general conclusions stated above.
The minimum working head (difference between the two
water-levels) which gives a constant discharge is greater
than would be the case in the absence of resistances. This
&#8220;minimum working head for modularity&#8221; has been
found to be &middot;21 foot, &middot;42 foot, and &middot;61 foot, the corresponding
values of the &#8220;depression,&#8221; <i>h</i>&#8320;, being respectively<span class="pagenum" id="Page195">[195]</span>
1 foot, 2 feet, and 3 feet. When the working head is
less than the above, the discharge is less and it depends
on the working head. The depression should, according
to Kennedy, be about 1&middot;75 feet, but it may be more.</p>

<p>The chief difficulty in using the gauge outlet as a
module is that the air vent can be stopped up. This
converts the apparatus into a compound diverging tube
(<i>Hydraulics</i>, Chap. III., Art. 17). The discharge is, of
course, increased, and it becomes dependent at all times
on the working head. Another difficulty is that any rise
or fall in the water-level of the distributary (and such
rises and falls may occur owing to silting or scour, however
carefully the discharge may be regulated) alters
the discharge somewhat, though not to the same degree
as in an ordinary outlet with a working head of, say,
&middot;5 foot. In short, Kennedy&#8217;s gauge outlet, or &#8220;semi-module&#8221;
as it is sometimes called, can modify but not
do away with the variations of the discharges of outlets.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
